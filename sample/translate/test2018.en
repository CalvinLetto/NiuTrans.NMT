Munich 18@@ 56 : Four maps that will change your view of the city
A mental asylum , where today young people are said to meet .
A cryp@@ t chap@@ el , where they are now dig@@ ging t@@ unn@@ els for the S @@@ -@@ @ Bahn .
Al@@ lo@@ t@@ ment holders cul@@ tiv@@ ate the soil of former farmers .
The oldest official map of Munich brings cap@@ tiv@@ ating stories to light .
It is anno@@ ying when geographical maps are not up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date .
Any@@ one who has ever got worked up because the car 's sat @@@ -@@ @ na@@ v is showing a green field instead of a b@@ yp@@ ass knows that .
The historical maps of the digital Bay@@ ern@@ Atlas , an offering from the State Government 's Ge@@ op@@ or@@ tal Bayern , are anything but up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date - and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so inform@@ ative .
Especially when one comp@@ ares them with current online maps .
Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich 's Merk@@ ur newspaper have changed since the 19th century .
The digital Bay@@ ern@@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work qu@@ ilt that one doesn 't quite recognise for what it is at first .
Within the large overview map , were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities , so @@@ -@@ @ called original @@@ -@@ @ lay @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ land sheets .
According to information from the Bavarian Sur@@ ve@@ ying and M@@ apping Authority , these came into being between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria .
Their commission@@ er : Nap@@ ol@@ eon .
The French army comm@@ ander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800 , during the War of the Second Co@@ alition with Austria .
Nap@@ ol@@ eon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ o@@ graphical survey - naturally for military purposes .
Even if the French troops finally re@@ treated with the Treaty of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9th February 18@@ 01 : it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph prop@@ elled the project further forward , founding the " Top@@ o@@ graphical Bureau " - and with that , the Bavarian Sur@@ ve@@ ying and M@@ apping Authority .
The original lay @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ land sheet for Munich origin@@ ates from 18@@ 56 and , like all the others , can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
The comparison of past / present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital .
The city has stret@@ ched out in all directions and co@@ al@@ es@@ ced .
An example of this is Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling , which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created .
Today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
Around 18@@ 56 , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling 's houses are concentrated along what is today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named in 18@@ 78 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a ring@@ leader of the Bavarian farmers ' revol@@ t against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
Where the West Park is today , one sees nothing but field - at first sight : upon zo@@ oming in , a more detailed small @@@ -@@ @ scale map with do@@ z@@ ens of lines and numbers appears : hand @@@ -@@ @ num@@ ber@@ ed p@@ lots from the so @@@ -@@ @ called " original record , " from which the property tax was derived .
Today , it is no longer farmers who occup@@ y small par@@ c@@ els there - rather , it is allo@@ t@@ ment holders of the " Land in Sonne " facility .
A large green area is apparent to the north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest , was in the 19th century still actually a " Wi@@ ese " - a me@@ adow - and not a concrete wa@@ st@@ eland .
On the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psy@@ chiat@@ ric medicine .
In the original lay @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ land sheet , in the area where today the bor@@ ough of Au @@@ -@@ @ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is , one can make out not only the street name " am Gast@@ ei@@ g " or the elev@@ ation " Auf der Lü@@ ften " - but can actually read in large letters " mental asylum . "
Yes , here on Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , they once impris@@ oned people with del@@ u@@ sions .
The Munich district mental asylum " Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften " had come to life there in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
From 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psy@@ chiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the practice of ch@@ ain@@ ing up the so @@@ -@@ @ called mad men .
What is more , he for@@ ba@@ de the staff from using violence against the in@@ m@@ ates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , leader of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , which has been bus@@ ying itself for an exhibition with the establishment .
Origin@@ ally there was place for 280 patients ; later this was expanded to 500 places .
At some point even this capacity was no longer enough - the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 19@@ 05 .
The Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Cl@@ inic , East Munich , has been located there since 2006 , one of the largest psy@@ chiat@@ ric units in Germany .
On the plot of the former Au@@ er institution , young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes .
To the west lies the football pit@@ ch of TS@@ V München Ost , and to the east , residential houses from the 1980s .
In 2015 , the " Casa Don Bo@@ sc@@ o " nur@@ ser@@ y was built - in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building , which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bom@@ b attacks .
Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded as the " main square " in around 18@@ 56 , and Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called " Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . "
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich .
The bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies t@@ ore many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
One big one remains up to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
The English Institute , small commercial premises and a cryp@@ t chap@@ el from the Middle A@@ ges once stood in the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days , preparations for the second S @@@ -@@ @ Bahn main line are under@@ way , with first dig@@ ging to follow on 5th April 2017 .
You can use the sli@@ der control to compare the old Munich map with the a@@ erial view from today - and to fill in the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
The National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Colo@@ red People has put out an al@@ ert for people of color traveling to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the state 's discriminatory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
" The N@@ A@@ ACP Travel Ad@@ visory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , effective through August 28@@ th , 2017 , calls for African American travel@@ ers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extreme cau@@ tion when traveling throughout the state given the series of question@@ able , race @@@ -@@ @ based inci@@ dents occur@@ ring stat@@ e@@ wide recently , and noted ther@@ ein , " the group 's statement reads .
A recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law making it har@@ der for people to win discrimination law@@ su@@ its , as well as the state 's law enforcement dis@@ proportion@@ ately target@@ ing minorities promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel al@@ ert , the N@@ A@@ ACP said .
" You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .
They 're being pul@@ led over because of their skin color , they 're being be@@ aten up or killed , " the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i N@@ A@@ ACP , Ro@@ d Chap@@ el , told The K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
" We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven 't heard before . "
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
The group c@@ ited inci@@ dents such as racial sl@@ urs against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state , and was taken into cu@@ sto@@ dy by Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General 's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pul@@ led over than wh@@ ites .
" The advisory is for people to be aware , and war@@ n their families and friends and co @@@ -@@ @ workers of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , " Chap@@ el said .
" People need to be ready , whether it 's bringing b@@ ail money with them , or let@@ ting rel@@ atives know they are traveling through the state . "
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 h@@ ate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI 's h@@ ate crime reporting program , ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
The travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination .
Pre@@ viously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel advis@@ ories for Texas and Ari@@ zona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to det@@ ain people on immigration violations which the AC@@ L@@ U said would increase racial pro@@ fil@@ ing .
Travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lat@@ ely , advoc@@ acy groups have res@@ or@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US .
Past@@ ure f@@ ence project is fundamental
The Fischer@@ bach past@@ ure f@@ ence project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
Members of the Bun@@ de@@ stag for the CD@@ U Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Ko@@ v@@ ac got a first @@@ -@@ @ hand view .
Representatives from the Fischer@@ bach local CD@@ U group met with may@@ or Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Recht@@ gra@@ ben@@ hof farm , belonging to the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family .
To start with , Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave insi@@ ghts into his business , in which he cul@@ tiv@@ ates 55 hectares of past@@ ure and 40 hectares of wood@@ land , keeps 40 milk co@@ ws and just as many young stock , and accommod@@ ates five apartments of holiday makers .
Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann says that , for him , there is no alternative to the " Black Forest milk " marketing channel he uses for the milk from his co@@ ws .
Only regional produce is served to the holiday @@@ -@@ @ makers .
Since he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman for Fischer@@ bach , he described the past@@ ure f@@ ence project as " fundamentally important . "
I can 't make a profit on that kind of ste@@ ep @@@ -@@ @ slo@@ ping ground .
Gra@@ ss@@ land areas make for a lot of work , a lot has to be done with the string tri@@ mmer .
" We have to gra@@ pp@@ le with the conditions and with the top@@ o@@ graphy here , " stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
In 2003 , he took over his parents ' business and he man@@ ages this without chemical cro@@ p protection and fertili@@ sers , even if it 's not an organic farm that he 's running .
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that " the community has recognised the importance of the past@@ ure f@@ ence project and is happy to have the Le@@ ader funding . "
The farmers need support to the t@@ une of 3000 to 4000 euros per hec@@ t@@ are .
One hopes that with that , aff@@ ore@@ station of the area could then be drawn out for a long while .
" The biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward , " stressed the may@@ or .
The farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding .
Using the past@@ ure f@@ ence funding , a total of 25 p@@ lots from el@@ even participants were fen@@ ced off in 2013 .
The areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ ore@@ sted until at least 20@@ 23 .
Of the total costs , to the t@@ une of 7@@ 1,@@ 500 euros , half was funded via Le@@ ader , and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischer@@ bach .
The farmers were thus left with 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in the 16.@@ 2 @@@ -@@ @ kilomet@@ re past@@ ure f@@ ence .
" The great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , " explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Ko@@ v@@ ac stressed : " You 're doing a really good job . Without farmers we 'd not be able to function . "
Peter Weiß is also standing firm : " First @@@ -@@ @ class food@@ stuffs are produced here . "
The Baden @@@ -@@ @ Württemberg directive on countryside conservation ( L@@ PR ) makes the government funding of past@@ ure f@@ ences possible .
Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open .
A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the L@@ PR .
In addition , the fen@@ ced @@@ -@@ @ off area is not allowed to be farm@@ able with a trac@@ tor ( gra@@ dient of over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened with aff@@ ore@@ station .
For the 2018 Fischer@@ bach past@@ ure f@@ ence project , an application is currently under@@ way from eight participants with 24 p@@ lots who would like to build just sh@@ y of 16 kilometres of f@@ ence .
The areas of land to be kept open equ@@ ate to 35 hectares ; the calculated costs amount to more than 112@@ ,000 euros .
Is nothing sacred ?
Now Trump 's White House is target@@ ing the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty
The su@@ rest mark of regime change is when they start att@@ acking the stat@@ ues .
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage @@@ -@@ @ man@@ ged top@@ pling of Saddam Hussein in Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax@@ e to the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty in a heated argument with CN@@ N 's J@@ im A@@ co@@ sta over the president 's proposals to dra@@ stically limit legal immigration .
In fair@@ ness , Mill@@ er did not attack the stat@@ ue itself .
A hor@@ de of boat @@@ -@@ @ trip owners and Liber@@ ty im@@ person@@ ators would have l@@ yn@@ ched him if he did .
But he did attack its meaning , and in particular the meaning as@@ cri@@ bed to it when Emma Laz@@ ar@@ us 's famous po@@ em was added to its base in 19@@ 03 , 17 years after the monument itself was completed .
As Mill@@ er sc@@ ol@@ ded A@@ co@@ sta : " I don 't want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty is .@@ .. a symbol of American liber@@ ty lighting the world .
The po@@ em that you 're referring to , that was added later and is not part of the original Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty . "
Mill@@ er is fac@@ tually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .
It is about the contemporary res@@ on@@ ance of Laz@@ ar@@ us 's star@@ t@@ ling words , the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your ti@@ red , your poor , / Your hu@@ dd@@ led mass@@ es year@@ ning to brea@@ the free , / The w@@ ret@@ ched refuse of your te@@ em@@ ing shore . "
There has never been a time when the " w@@ ret@@ ched refuse " has been more visible on our screens .
Mill@@ er was not eng@@ aging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump 's USA .
This conflict about the meaning of a stat@@ ue is part of a wider political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the meaning of America .
Laz@@ ar@@ us - and her friends who campaign@@ ed to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were eng@@ aging in a highly political act .
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism by representing in a well @@@ -@@ @ wor@@ n classical trop@@ e , the female embo@@ di@@ ment of Liber@@ ty .
Laz@@ ar@@ us changed that meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
And she gives herself a very different name : Mother of Ex@@ iles .
The mar@@ rying of the po@@ em to the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a dev@@ a@@ stating attack on American n@@ ativ@@ ism .
And just as Laz@@ ar@@ us changed the meaning of the stat@@ ue , righ@@ tw@@ ing@@ ers have long wanted to change it back .
The great lou@@ d@@ mouth R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that Liber@@ ty is not inviting anyone in , but is rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , taking the American fl@@ ame out to the ben@@ i@@ ghted world : " Lady Liber@@ ty is step@@ ping forward .
She is meant to be carrying the tor@@ ch of liber@@ ty from the United States to the rest of the world .
The tor@@ ch is not to light the way to the United States . "
Rather un@@ usually , Lim@@ bau@@ gh actually hit on something .
The meaning of the stat@@ ue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception .
Laz@@ ar@@ us 's great imagin@@ ative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhau@@ sted , w@@ ret@@ ched but hop@@ e@@ ful people on the de@@ cks of ships after long and often dre@@ ad@@ ful jour@@ neys .
It is liter@@ ally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refu@@ ge and a chance to better their lives .
Her stat@@ ue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
And of course , this is not the perspective Mill@@ er and Trump want ever to recognise .
Their tor@@ ch is meant not to light the way , but to infl@@ ame the hat@@ reds that are their only source of power .
World Champi@@ on@@ ships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scot@@ tish members of Team GB
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two Sco@@ ts made the GB team
UK Ath@@ le@@ tics ' performance director N@@ eil Black says the 16 @@@ -@@ @ strong Scot@@ tish cont@@ ingent in the World Champi@@ on@@ ships squ@@ ad will make " a massive contribution to the team . "
A record number of Scot@@ tish ath@@ let@@ es have been selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
Black believes " there 's something special evol@@ ving " in Scotland and UK ath@@ le@@ tics must learn from that .
" We embra@@ ce it and we 're trying to understand it and we 'll push on that until we work it out , " Black said .
" I speak to people in the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sport and they think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
Scot@@ tish Ath@@ le@@ tics think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
British ath@@ le@@ tics : it 's something to do with what they 've done .
And the gu@@ y on the corner street , too .
W@@ hat@@ ever the combination of circumstances , it 's absolutely brilliant . "
Several of the Scot@@ tish ath@@ let@@ es are med@@ al con@@ ten@@ ders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will race against Sir M@@ o Far@@ ah in the 5,@@ 000@@ m , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was voted by the squ@@ ad to be team cap@@ tain .
" E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is slightly modest .
Her cap@@ tain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .
" A number of ath@@ let@@ es , whether they were Scot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , wal@@ ked out of that room feeling hu@@ gely proud and really motivated .
The passion and real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally put into it were great . "
The Comm@@ on@@ wealth silver med@@ al@@ list , who will compete in the 400@@ m hur@@ d@@ les at her fifth World Champi@@ on@@ ships , says it 's " incredible " 16 Sco@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland 's previous best total of ath@@ let@@ es at the worlds was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
Middle @@@ -@@ @ distance run@@ ner Mu@@ ir is leading the way , having set five British and two European records in the past year .
She will go in the 15@@ 00@@ m and the 5,@@ 000@@ m .
Chris O '@@ H@@ are , who runs in the 15@@ 00@@ m , is another Sco@@ t to watch , following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the An@@ ni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ on@@ ships , when the only other Sco@@ t in the team was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
The team cap@@ tain says she 's " hu@@ gely proud " of the fact so many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots have not only made the team , but , in some cases , will be challenging for med@@ als and comp@@ eting to make fin@@ als .
" The special thing about being team cap@@ tain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team , so that it was such a huge honour any@@ way but to know that your te@@ amm@@ ates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra @@@ -@@ @ special for me , " she added .
" Ob@@ viously , I 'm very proud of all the Sco@@ ts who 've made the team .
It just shows how far we 've come .
And they 're here as well @@@ -@@ @ established ath@@ let@@ es , ath@@ let@@ es that are going to be looking to get on po@@ di@@ ums .
As for my cap@@ tain 's speech ?
Y@@ e@@ ah , I think it went well .
I just drew on the fact that we 're very lu@@ cky in this situation in that we 've got a home World Champi@@ on@@ ships .
So it 's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thri@@ ving on the fact that we 're back at the Olympic Stadium .
I 'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it 's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there . "
Blo@@ cking cri@@ tics from Facebook : Don 't run for public office , if you can 't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press .
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn 't take long for newspapers to start sl@@ amm@@ ing him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
He ch@@ af@@ ed at the criticism , sure .
But he did not silence his cri@@ tics .
Because back in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , " the freedom of Spe@@ ech may be taken away - and , du@@ mb & silent we may be led , like sheep , to the S@@ lau@@ ghter . "
That brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Go@@ v. Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who needs to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan 's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who vo@@ ic@@ ed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
And the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him for that earlier this week .
The govern@@ or 's staff dis@@ missed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comm@@ entary was rich with a " who ca@@ res ? " bac@@ kl@@ ash .
" It 's only Facebook , " plenty of fol@@ ks said .
But it matters .
And it especially matters when it 's a gu@@ y like Ho@@ gan .
This is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly Democratic state who is ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
He has the second @@@ -@@ @ highest approval rating of the nation 's 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
He 's shown a ste@@ ady hand in leading his state and a stern adher@@ ence to principles .
He 's also been pretty de@@ ft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents , play@@ fully deb@@ uting his hair@@ less head after chem@@ o treatments on his page .
So blo@@ cking people who come to the govern@@ or 's page - which is a public forum , lab@@ eled as official and ad@@ mini@@ stered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
In an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spo@@ kes@@ woman A@@ me@@ lia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the govern@@ or 's actions , argu@@ ing that blo@@ cking the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
But it 's too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ e@@ ful fol@@ ks lash@@ ing out online .
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
And they 're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business owner and a past@@ or , not troll@@ s .
They all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not pro@@ fan@@ e .
The past@@ or quo@@ ted the Bible in his post , appe@@ aling to Ho@@ gan 's Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , wasn 't hat@@ e@@ ful , but she asked about h@@ ate crimes .
" I poli@@ tel@@ y commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to h@@ ate crimes and other recent news items , " she wrote in the comment section of The Post 's news story .
" I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately dis@@ regarded by some as a so @@@ -@@ @ called collective effort , rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens . "
What the govern@@ or 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack " others would probably call " advoc@@ acy . "
The Facebook era makes it easy to tail@@ or a message by simply blo@@ cking a cri@@ tic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
It 's a lot cleaner than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als or arre@@ sting and sil@@ encing prote@@ sters .
But that 's exactly what 's happening , only digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan isn 't the first public official to be cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for def@@ ang@@ ing Facebook and other social media .
President Trump is being su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
One of the first land@@ mark rul@@ ings on this issue came down last week in Vir@@ g@@ inia .
The chair of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors viol@@ ated the First Amendment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a constitu@@ ent from her Facebook page .
And in K@@ entu@@ cky , Go@@ v. Mat@@ t Be@@ vin ( R ) also got a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U over his use of Facebook and Twitter .
This sh@@ ouldn 't be so hard .
In Washington 's time , the era of affordable post@@ age had an impact much like the Internet .
The number of newspapers quad@@ ru@@ pled between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an@@ onymous letter writ@@ ers ham@@ mer@@ ed his leadership .
And even back then , Washington had an@@ onymous troll@@ s .
People using the p@@ seu@@ don@@ y@@ ms " Jur@@ ic@@ ola , " " Val@@ eri@@ us , " " Beli@@ s@@ ari@@ us , " and " Por@@ tius " all wrote letters to newspapers tra@@ shing Washington 's decisions .
Peti@@ tions cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing his stand on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Commerce , and Navigation with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
But he did not silence them .
Freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and dis@@ course lie at the very foundation of our nation .
And true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hop@@ ing for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosts the 25th edition of the Scot@@ tish Senior Open .
The Northern Iris@@ h@@ man , who led next door at Ar@@ cher@@ field Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul E@@ ales , is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament am@@ bassador on behalf of the club 's founder and CEO Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
" I wat@@ ched Renaissance Club being built , and we 're seeing it come to its glory with this event , " said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
" The players will see this course at its finest , it is in fab@@ ul@@ ous condition .
Jer@@ ry has done a fab@@ ul@@ ous job setting this place up .
He 's a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
This is a great show@@ case for this course . "
Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a champi@@ onship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32 @@@ -@@ @ year career .
" This does feel really special , " said the South@@ port @@@ -@@ @ based player .
" I didn 't get to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it .
Com@@ ing back to this part of the world is mag@@ ical .
It 's a wonderful place to play golf in .
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
It was a really special time and one we will always cher@@ ish . "
Mak@@ ing his return to action on home soil is G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year .
This event will be his first Scot@@ tish appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
" It always means a little bit more when you 're playing at home , " said Hel@@ ens@@ burgh man Or@@ r .
" You want to do well ; but you do feel that extra pressure .
I 've really enjoyed playing again and I 've played some solid golf .
I 'm happy with how it 's going so far . "
Jo@@ ining the tri@@ o in the field are former Ma@@ sters winner I@@ an Woo@@ sn@@ am and Senior major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty .
Or@@ r and former Ry@@ der Cup cap@@ tain S@@ am Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among six Sco@@ ts in the field , the others being Andrew O@@ ld@@ cor@@ n , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ro@@ ss Dru@@ m@@ mond .

Fe@@ wer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
In past two decades , an ever decre@@ asing number of people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking .
This is the conclusion drawn by scientists from the University Medical Centre Hamburg @@@ -@@ @ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
" According to our estim@@ ations , 167 lung cancer deaths a year can be attri@@ buted to passive smoking , " said study leader Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher .
For comparison , he referred to one of his own studies on this topic from 1994 .
Back then , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany .
The new study is published in the " International Journal of Public Health . "
Home connections prove to be very complex
The building works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full throw and " are more or less on schedule , " according to the manager of the construction yard , F@@ red Hein@@ ze .
In terms of home connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , since lots of things are hidden in the sub@@ str@@ ate that were not noted in the plans .
The traffic , which always dis@@ rup@@ ts building works , poses a big problem for the St@@ um@@ pp company construction crew .
" The ign@@ or@@ ance of car drivers around red lights and barriers is really huge , " reports Hein@@ ze .
The street is closed off and only the public b@@ usses are allowed to drive through .
Angel@@ o Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the St@@ um@@ pp company have been engaged in the works on the bridges for weeks .
" The hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting , for sure .
But lu@@ ck@@ ily we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Mat@@ t , " explained Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
Po@@ verty and Death in Indonesia 's Land of Gold
When Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn 't use a stove .
She rarely even uses a pot .
In her wooden home in En@@ aro@@ tal@@ i , the capital of P@@ ani@@ ai re@@ gency in the res@@ tive Indone@@ sian province of Pap@@ ua , the hou@@ se@@ wife usually just places a sweet pot@@ ato - known locally as " no@@ ta " - directly into the fireplace .
After half @@@ -@@ @ an @@@ -@@ @ hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed and dev@@ oured with e@@ ager , un@@ wash@@ ed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i si@@ ts on the mu@@ d floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also perform@@ s her daily cho@@ res , such as washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
A bu@@ cket in a roo@@ fl@@ ess room serves as a lat@@ r@@ ine .
As the young@@ est of her husband 's four wi@@ ves , she has been assigned no fields to tend .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
Of course , working late can be dangerous : Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily , plus there are the soldiers .
" No one da@@ res to walk around the village after 5 p.m. , " she says .
It 's a rare gli@@ mp@@ se of daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was absor@@ bed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum , when just 1,@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ ders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occup@@ ying troops .
An existing movement ag@@ it@@ ating for independence against Dutch rule swi@@ ft@@ ly turned its ire against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains tight control over the region , bar@@ ring foreign journalists or rights monitors .
In 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent Pap@@ ua New Guinea occup@@ ying the eastern part of the island .
En@@ aro@@ tal@@ i is as remote as it is des@@ ol@@ ate ; the journey here involves a 90 @@@ -@@ @ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a stom@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ur@@ ning five @@@ -@@ @ hour drive by hire car .
There is no public transport .
The town of some 19@@ ,000 people consists of wooden houses ring@@ ed by b@@ am@@ bo@@ o fen@@ cing , cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated iron roo@@ fs transformed by rust into var@@ ying ta@@ wn@@ y sha@@ des .
Very few Indone@@ si@@ ans have made the journey here , let alone journalists , and practically no foreign@@ ers .
Before Christian mis@@ sion@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shi@@ ped a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
There were other changes , too .
" We were not used to we@@ aring these clothes , " says De@@ ge@@ i , indic@@ ating her vi@@ vi@@ dly colored , hand @@@ -@@ @ wo@@ ven tur@@ ban , dark shirt and a bright skir@@ t .
" Before , we only wor@@ e leaves on our bodies . "
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
But it is also Indonesia 's land of gold .
The world 's largest and most profitable gold mine , Gra@@ s@@ berg , owned by Phoenix @@@ -@@ @ based Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , lies just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province around the size of New Jersey and home to 15@@ 3,@@ 000 people .
In 2015 alone , Free@@ port min@@ ed some $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here .
In addition , Pap@@ ua boasts tim@@ ber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
These ri@@ ches are , however , a source of mis@@ ery for Pap@@ u@@ ans , ensuring Indonesia 's powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an calls for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden goo@@ se , and are dealt with mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess@@ ly .
According to rights activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ u@@ ans have been killed , and thousands more have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and impris@@ oned by the Indone@@ sian military since 1969 .
Mass k@@ ill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua 's tri@@ bal high@@ lands during the 197@@ 0s amounted to genocide , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
Indone@@ sian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters in the region last year alone .
We Will Lo@@ se Everything , a 2016 report by the Arch@@ dio@@ c@@ ese of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e , contains testim@@ ony of at@@ ro@@ cities committed the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial exec@@ utions , torture - rap@@ e and electro@@ cu@@ tion are especially popular , according to another report - and the brutal cr@@ ush@@ ing of peaceful demonstrations .
" It 's difficult to count the number of victims as inci@@ dents happen every week , " says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
The scre@@ ws have tigh@@ tened as Pap@@ ua 's resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
The province 's 3.5 million population is 83 % Christian , but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia 's popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ ne@@ o , Sum@@ at@@ ra and Sul@@ a@@ wes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese war@@ ung can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chi@@ cken and g@@ ado @@@ -@@ @ g@@ ado mixed @@@ -@@ @ vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sau@@ ce .
Local people struggle to compete .
" The migrants started to sell chi@@ cken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ u@@ ans , " explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old P@@ ani@@ ai native who moved to the provin@@ cial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for work .
" It made the native Pap@@ u@@ ans - the m@@ ama @@@ -@@ @ m@@ ama [ the women ] of Pap@@ ua - lose their market . "
Indone@@ sian President Jo@@ ko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i , vo@@ wed to address the ine@@ qualities and rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
The former car@@ p@@ enter secured 27 of Pap@@ ua 's total 29 districts - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the Pre@@ sidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
But precious little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today local people feel betra@@ yed .
" Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i , with the expec@@ tation that he would ful@@ fill our hopes for justice to be restored , " You says .
In fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a n@@ adi@@ r just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i 's October inaugur@@ ation .
On Dec@@ . 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children were outside sin@@ ging Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ aro@@ tal@@ i when two Indone@@ sian soldiers on a motor@@ bike broke through the glo@@ om .
The star@@ t@@ led children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
One of the soldiers took um@@ bra@@ ge at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local Past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
The soldiers , who had been drinking , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le but@@ ts , said victims and wit@@ nesses .
Then one of the soldiers fi@@ red into the group of children .
One child , 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Y@@ uli@@ an@@ us Y@@ ei@@ mo , was be@@ aten so badly he fell into a com@@ a .
A couple of hours later , the nearby government El@@ ection Commission building was set ab@@ la@@ ze , and things escal@@ ated the following day .
About 1,000 young Pap@@ u@@ an men , women and children gathered on a so@@ ccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice .
They carried cerem@@ oni@@ al hunting bo@@ ws and performed the wa@@ ita dance - running in cir@@ cles and simul@@ ating bir@@ d@@ song - of Pap@@ ua 's Me@@ e P@@ ago tri@@ be .
Some prote@@ sters started hur@@ ling stones at police and military posts .
As temp@@ ers grew more heated , an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio : " If the mass@@ es offer resistance more than three times , sho@@ ot them dead , " it said , according to an official document seen by T@@ IM@@ E that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Ko@@ to neighborhood of En@@ aro@@ tal@@ i , saw the imp@@ ending danger and appe@@ aled for calm , im@@ pl@@ oring the crow@@ d to go back home .
No@@ body was in the mood to listen .
" When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left w@@ rist , " he told T@@ IM@@ E on the por@@ ch of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn 't know who fi@@ red but says the bul@@ let came from the ranks of am@@ ass@@ ed soldiers .
" It was crow@@ ded , many shots were fi@@ red , " he adds .
Local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , according to his c@@ ous@@ in who witness@@ ed the sho@@ ot@@ ings .
" I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , " Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indone@@ si@@ ans only goes by one name , told T@@ IM@@ E som@@ ber@@ ly .
" I saw he was dead .@@ .. I k@@ is@@ sed him . "
The Pap@@ ua Police Chief In@@ spec@@ tor General Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers were only " securing " their station because it was under attack .
" We have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , " Pap@@ ua Police spo@@ kes@@ person , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo said in 2015 .
" It 's a matter of life and death . "
According to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
News of the k@@ ill@@ ings only fil@@ tered through to Jak@@ arta the following day .
Three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i gave an imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , where he expressed symp@@ ath@@ ies with the victims ' families and vo@@ wed to address the historic ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
" I want this case to be solved immediately so it won 't ever happen again in the future , " he said .
Security Minister Wir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non @@@ -@@ @ judicial mechanism to sett@@ le historic human @@@ -@@ @ rights violations .
But the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
" Most of the violations occurred a long time ago .
Some were in the ' 90@@ s and in early 200@@ 0s .
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , " he said .
Then Wir@@ an@@ to back@@ tra@@ cked when speaking to T@@ IM@@ E in Jak@@ arta on June 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a gri@@ ev@@ ance mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
Instead , " All will be settled by law , " he said .
Wir@@ an@@ to , who the U.@@ N@@ . has indic@@ ted for " crimes against humanity " relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Tim@@ or 's blo@@ ody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human @@@ -@@ @ rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been settled , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident .
Famili@@ es of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims gre@@ eted such claims with gri@@ m incre@@ du@@ lity .
" I 've been inter@@ viewed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , " Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says .
" I 'm ti@@ red . "
He says that years later , he still lives in fear .
" I 'm afraid , " he says .
" I 'm afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . "
His brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus echo@@ ed the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are f@@ ear@@ ful of discussing the incident .
He says he was be@@ aten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
" After bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , " he says .
The sho@@ ot@@ ings haven 't stopped .
On Tuesday , Indone@@ sian police shot at vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ai 's neighbor@@ ing D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai re@@ gency .
One person died and 17 others were wo@@ und@@ ed , including children , during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
The man , 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Ra@@ vi@@ an@@ us Dou@@ w who dro@@ wn@@ ed while he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
In@@ c@@ ens@@ ed vill@@ agers pro@@ tested in front of the company 's site office .
Police said the vill@@ agers thre@@ w rocks at officers , who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
But loc@@ als say the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indone@@ sian par@@ am@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crow@@ d , killing one .
" We were so p@@ ani@@ cked , we are afraid there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , " 29 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness@@ ed the in@@ ju@@ red being hur@@ ried in , tells T@@ IM@@ E .
" I have been hi@@ ding in my house for two days . "
The D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile bri@@ g@@ ade to be with@@ drawn from the area .
P@@ ani@@ ai has always been a troub@@ les@@ pot for the Indone@@ sian government .
The lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i , and Dam@@ al peoples , who live spra@@ w@@ led across Pap@@ ua 's ver@@ d@@ ant central high@@ lands .
Many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ u@@ ans by launching spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ki@@ dn@@ apping ra@@ ids on Indone@@ sian soldiers .
Some of the top O@@ PM leaders ha@@ il from P@@ ani@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
In response , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detain@@ ed by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of " safeguarding national sovereignty . "
Some never re@@ appear .
Among the people of Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place . "
Po@@ verty fe@@ eds the dis@@ content .
The little rice on sale in En@@ aro@@ tal@@ i is too expensive for loc@@ als to buy .
Bre@@ ad is just as out of reach .
People here grow everything they eat : mainly no@@ ta plus some fruit and le@@ af@@ y vegetables .
Far@@ ming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet pot@@ ato .
They usually keep most of the har@@ vest for the family , with the rest sold in the local market .
T@@ en pieces of no@@ ta cost only 10@@ ,000 Indone@@ sian ru@@ pi@@ ah ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
Over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ u@@ ans and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nab@@ ire Airport .
What few jobs exist typically go to the better @@@ -@@ @ educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ thi@@ er migrants .
Pap@@ u@@ ans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competi@@ tively .
" The young people are not interested to stay in the village .@@ .. because there 's no jobs or money here , " says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council of P@@ ani@@ ai .
Isol@@ ation keeps the world 's eyes off Pap@@ ua .
In addition , reporting restrictions for international media remain tight .
Ear@@ lier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua for a " lack of coordination with related institutions " despite having been granted rare permission to film .
According to P@@ he@@ li@@ m K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i 's election campaign ple@@ dges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized .
" There are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report from Indonesia 's res@@ tive e@@ ast@@ ern@@ most provin@@ ces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and black@@ listing , " he said in a statement .
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indone@@ sian government has been largely limited to Pap@@ ua 's immediate neighb@@ ors .
In March , six Pacific nations - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ shall Islands , and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands - urged the U.@@ N@@ . Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread violations " in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
These same countries have histor@@ ically backed the O@@ PM .
Indone@@ sian Foreign Ministry spo@@ kes@@ person Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r shr@@ ug@@ ged off the group 's alleg@@ ations , telling journalists in Jak@@ arta , " In Indonesia , a democratic system still applies and there 's free media so it 's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . "
Local people want more foreign governments to take note .
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the nation 's human rights am@@ bassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence , bes@@ e@@ ech@@ ing , " We want freedom , " according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay an@@ onymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ u@@ ans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i .
" Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting , " says G@@ ob@@ ai , the tri@@ bal council chairman .
He wants Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i to know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , aside from living under the lo@@ oming threat of a rap@@ acious military , wal@@ low in des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ u@@ ans , consider their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ w@@ i as a " debt " he must re@@ pay .
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .
Despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : bur@@ ying one victim 's body on land just opposite the police and military station .
Kno@@ wing that justice may never be served , at least they won 't let those responsible forget their crimes .
" A member of our family has been killed , " says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus , head bo@@ wed .
" What else could we do ? "
Fire eng@@ ul@@ fs Dubai 's ' Tor@@ ch ' sk@@ y@@ scra@@ per for second time
A fire ri@@ pped through one of the world 's t@@ all@@ est residential to@@ wers in Dubai on Friday , forcing hundreds of occup@@ ants to fle@@ e the 33@@ 7 met@@ re @@@ -@@ @ t@@ all , 79 @@@ -@@ @ sto@@ rey structure .
It 's the second bla@@ ze to swe@@ ep through the high @@@ -@@ @ rise - which happens to be called the Tor@@ ch tower - in just two years .
The building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , no inj@@ uries were reported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the bla@@ ze .
" We were sleeping and we wo@@ ke up to the fire alarm and people scre@@ aming .
We ran down the sta@@ irs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50@@ th floor , " a resident who gave his name as George told Re@@ uters .
Dubai 's civil defence authorities said fire@@ fighting squ@@ ads put out the bla@@ ze at around 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ 00 GM@@ T ) and were cooling the building .
The government said it was working on providing shel@@ ter for those affected .
The incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used on the exter@@ iors of t@@ all buildings across the world .
An investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cl@@ adding , exter@@ ior pan@@ elling used for decoration or insulation .
In the UK , police have said they believe the system of insulation and cl@@ adding panels on London 's Gren@@ fell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died .
No Dav@@ is Cup reform : Best @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ five continues
The president of the International Tennis Federation has failed with his big Dav@@ is Cup cou@@ p in the general assembly .
At the meeting in H@@ o Ch@@ i Min@@ h City , the ( for this sport ) revolutionary suggestion to from now on play the Dav@@ is Cup sing@@ les over only best @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ three sets received just sh@@ y - by a wh@@ is@@ ker - of the necessary two @@@ -@@ @ thirds majority in support .
The ad@@ mit@@ tedly often very long , but for that reason also greatly treas@@ ured , five @@@ -@@ @ set classi@@ cs are therefore survi@@ ving in the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform ; IT@@ F president David H@@ ag@@ ger@@ ty 's objective was therefore only just missed .
" We respect the decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Dav@@ is Cup and Fed Cup .
We need change in order to secure the long @@@ -@@ @ term future of this i@@ con@@ ic and historic competition , " said H@@ ag@@ ger@@ ty .
There will continue to be work done to improve the competition .
After many objec@@ tions be@@ fore@@ hand already , the suggestion to hold the final at a neutral location did not even make it to the vote .
New from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so , in future , the fin@@ alists of the David Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year .
In order to keep costs to a minimum for organis@@ ers , the requirements in matters of training courts etc. are being simplified and the players will not have to give so many official media appoint@@ ments ahead of the Dav@@ is Cup .
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft , survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had kno@@ w@@ ingly or unkno@@ w@@ ingly s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led prohibited items past the US Transpor@@ tation Security Administration check@@ points onto the aircraft , including at least 6 per cent who bo@@ arded the plane while un@@ inten@@ tionally carrying prohibited kni@@ ves or other bl@@ aded objects .
L@@ ess than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered bel@@ at@@ edly that they had mistakenly trav@@ elled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet @@@ -@@ @ char@@ tering service Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . - also found that younger travellers were more likely to fl@@ out the rules .
Of the respon@@ dents who admitted kno@@ w@@ ingly trying to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent were mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X@@ .
The most common items wh@@ is@@ ked past T@@ SA agents on purpose were food and liqui@@ ds .
More than 3 per cent admitted kno@@ w@@ ingly carrying bl@@ aded items past security , while 2.2 per cent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of male respon@@ dents also acknowledged inten@@ tionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft .
The company said it surve@@ yed travellers around the country to find out how many had acci@@ dent@@ ally brought contra@@ band through airport security and how many had done so on purpose .
It 's no surprise that the people most likely to hau@@ l contra@@ band past security - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unkno@@ w@@ ingly - were those who fly the most .
As the company points out , however , the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
People are often un@@ certain of what liqui@@ ds they can carry or how much of them .
So it 's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff sei@@ zed by the T@@ SA happens to be for@@ bidden liqui@@ ds .
For a time , people thought the T@@ SA might be tre@@ ating books as contra@@ band .
Liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international ones .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn 't care : T@@ ens of thousands of T@@ es@@ la customers cancel their orders
Electronics @@@ -@@ @ mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ talent El@@ on Mus@@ k li@@ kes to bra@@ g about the huge number of p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ orders for his new T@@ es@@ la " Model 3 . "
Up until now , he has with@@ held the fact that a portion of these customers have already cancelled their non @@@ -@@ @ binding reservations .
Al@@ ongside the always trium@@ ph@@ ant figures for sales increases and the even more gigan@@ tic sales targets , with the announcement of the most recent quar@@ terly financial statement , T@@ es@@ la bo@@ ss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time had to reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number : that of the cancell@@ ations for the new mass @@@ -@@ @ market Model 3 .
In recent months , Mus@@ k had frequently used those more than 500@@ ,000 p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ orders to talk up the new car , for which distribution is just starting .
Mus@@ k now conc@@ e@@ des that of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 total p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ orders , 6@@ 3,@@ 000 have already been re@@ trac@@ ted .
Cri@@ tics had time and again pointed out that they were only non @@@ -@@ @ binding reservations .
In cases of cancellation , T@@ es@@ la pays the 1000 @@@ -@@ @ euro ( in the USA , 1000 @@@ -@@ @ US @@@ -@@ @ dollar , and in Great Britain , 1000 @@@ -@@ @ po@@ und ) " reservation deposit " back in its enti@@ re@@ ty .
There are currently 455@@ ,000 such non @@@ -@@ @ binding reservations , conc@@ eded Mus@@ k in a conference call with anal@@ yst@@ s .
However , the T@@ es@@ la bo@@ ss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem .
His argument : The challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
Last year , T@@ es@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,@@ 000 vehicles .
In 2018 - all models taken together - it is said to be 500@@ ,000 , and in 2020 , a million .
The demand is therefore clearly there .
According to Mus@@ k , a further 1800 reservations arrive each day .
Any@@ one who orders a " Model 3 " today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the ear@@ liest - that 's if T@@ es@@ la man@@ ages to get its brand @@@ -@@ @ span@@ king new production lines going , as of yet never tested in practice , without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions and at maximum capacity .
Many experts doubt whether that 's possible .
Should there be major delays , however , the non @@@ -@@ @ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for T@@ es@@ la .
For the company cannot then prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt Back@@ tracks on Del@@ ay@@ ing Obama @@@ -@@ @ Er@@ a Rules to Re@@ duce Emis@@ sions
One day after getting su@@ ed by 15 states , Environmental Protection Agency chief Sco@@ tt P@@ ru@@ itt rever@@ sed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama @@@ -@@ @ era rules reducing emissions of smo@@ g @@@ -@@ @ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency being more respon@@ sive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators .
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appe@@ als court .
At issue is an Oc@@ t. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground @@@ -@@ @ level o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid " inter@@ fer@@ ing with local decisions or imp@@ eding economic growth . "
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma 's state at@@ tor@@ ney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long served as a reliable opp@@ onent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
Since arriving in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil @@@ -@@ @ fuel industries .
Wednesday 's su@@ dden re@@ versal is the latest legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ itt 's regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
Last month , a federal appe@@ als court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator over@@ step@@ ped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
In a statement issued Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested his about @@@ -@@ @ face on o@@ zone standards simply reinforced the EPA 's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time .
" Under previous administrations , EPA would often fail to meet design@@ ation deadlines , and then wait to be su@@ ed by activ@@ ist groups and others , agre@@ eing in a settlement to set sched@@ ules for design@@ ation , " said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA more than a do@@ zen times in his prior job .
" We do not believe in regulation through li@@ tig@@ ation , and we take deadlines seriously .
We also take the stat@@ ute and the authority it gives us seriously . "
Still , the EPA 's statement said P@@ ru@@ itt may at some point once again use his " delay authority and all other authority legally available " to ensure regulations " are founded on sound policy and the best available information . "
Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are push@@ ing for a broader re@@ write of the o@@ zone rules .
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years .
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Sen@@ ate .
New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure .
" The EPA 's re@@ versal - following our law@@ su@@ its - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the over 115 million Americans directly imp@@ acted by smo@@ g po@@ uring into their communities , " Schnei@@ der@@ man said .
New York was joined in the case by California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .
Gro@@ und @@@ -@@ @ level o@@ zone is created when common poll@@ ut@@ ants emit@@ ted by cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sun@@ light .
The resulting smo@@ g can cause serious brea@@ thing problems among sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of pre@@ mature deaths each year .
Public health advoc@@ ates and environment@@ alists che@@ ered P@@ ru@@ itt 's surprising change of course .
" It 's distur@@ bing how much pressure it took to get this comm@@ on@@ sense step from the gu@@ y in charge of protecting the air we brea@@ the , " said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
" We 've got to keep fighting the Trump administration 's ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade to p@@ ander to pol@@ lu@@ ters and special interests . "
Tum@@ lingen is celeb@@ rating 750 years of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Church
750 years of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Church : To mark the anniversary of the mountain church , inv@@ it@@ ations are being issued to a ser@@ en@@ ade in the old c@@ emetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30@@ p@@ m.
Due to its idyl@@ lic setting and beautiful view over the village , the historical site of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us is a bel@@ o@@ ved place to tar@@ ry a while .
Visi@@ tors to the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can let themselves be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
The Friends and Sup@@ por@@ ters of Tum@@ lingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area their concern .
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a one @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ kind rural je@@ wel . "
The St. Hil@@ ari@@ us chap@@ el was first mentioned in records in 12@@ 67 in the Württemberg register : Coun@@ t Hermann von Sul@@ z sold " the mountain with the parish church for Tum@@ lingen on it , together with the Bai@@ li@@ wick " to Master Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 silver marks .
According to the text of the official document , aside from the former parish church , a l@@ ord@@ ly farm also stood on the Tum@@ lingen mountain , which itself owned the church , or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age , and not the other way around .
People therefore also lived there too .
As is apparent from the upper administrative office for Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt 's description in 18@@ 58 , the " mountain " was , alongside the lower village and the upper village that can just about be made out still in the appearance of Tum@@ lingen today , the village 's third , grand centre of settlement .
All maps from the time of around 1600 substanti@@ ate this historical reality .
The right of pat@@ ron@@ age aro@@ se out of the Early Middle @@@ -@@ @ Age propri@@ etary church law .
A l@@ ord who built and furnished a church and sta@@ ff@@ ed it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequ@@ e@@ ath this propri@@ etary church right .
Associ@@ ated with this was the right to ap@@ point a priest or nom@@ inate a new priest to the bishop .
There were three al@@ tar@@ s in the church and two b@@ ells in the tower .
The larger of the two sh@@ atter@@ ed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
The newly acquired bell then first ch@@ im@@ ed in 16@@ 92 , but had to later be sur@@ ren@@ dered in the Second World War , in 1942 .
During the 30 Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were sm@@ ash@@ ed in and the bell rop@@ es stol@@ en .
The roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
In 17@@ 96 , French troops made camp in the vicinity of the church .
They brought out the pul@@ pit and the pe@@ ws and used them as fire@@ wood .
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
Up until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ ari@@ us c@@ emetery in Tum@@ lingen served as the last place of rest for Hör@@ schwei@@ ler 's dead .
In 18@@ 23 , the c@@ emetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us church was demo@@ li@@ shed .
Only the church tower was left standing .
On new year 's eve of 18@@ 34 , a stor@@ m cle@@ av@@ ed the church tower and half of it collap@@ sed .
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was pul@@ led down .
Only the d@@ war@@ f tower that is still present today survi@@ ved as witness of the church 's 750 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old history .
Today Hor@@ st K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rol@@ f @@@ -@@ @ Dieter W@@ as@@ em from the " Industri@@ ous Pen@@ sion@@ ers " care for the Hil@@ ari@@ us site , as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
As event organis@@ er , the Friends and Sup@@ por@@ ters of Tum@@ lingen are issu@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ations to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade in the old c@@ emetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chap@@ el , on Sunday 16th July .
It is being arranged by the Ke@@ pler G@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt , comb@@ o , with speeches from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Municip@@ al administrator Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann gave the closing words .
The programme starts at 4.@@ 30@@ p@@ m.
Last admission is at 3.@@ 30@@ p@@ m.
The ser@@ en@@ ade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the c@@ emetery .
" Enjoy a summer 's evening under the sh@@ adows of old trees and with a wide view over the me@@ adows right up to forest , " invite the organis@@ ers , emphasi@@ sing the fantastic view .
The ser@@ en@@ ade will only take place in the case of dry weather .
The organis@@ ers are hop@@ ing for many back@@ ers in favour of preser@@ ving the historic St. Hil@@ ari@@ us site , which is important to Tum@@ lingen and to Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
The Friends and Sup@@ por@@ ters of Tum@@ lingen feel especially bound to take care of their local region , as ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini reinforced .
Association wants to have wind tur@@ bine approval examined
" Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ehrt sich , " sees no legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the District Administrator .
The association " Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ehrt sich " has called on District Administrator Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to re@@ trac@@ t his approval for the construction of planned wind turbin@@ es in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
They say it was un@@ law@@ ful .
The association ar@@ gues that at the time the approval was given on 30@@ th December 2016 , no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved in Bo@@ sh@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Vier@@ sen , on the city bound@@ ary with Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone , but at the same time , the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area .
Such zones are said to prevent " as@@ par@@ agu@@ si@@ sation " of the landscape .
The city of Vier@@ sen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , through an amendment to the local land @@@ -@@ @ use plan - but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error .
" Due to the lack of legal planning requirements , the approval decision that was issued is still un@@ law@@ ful , and should therefore be re@@ trac@@ ted as well , " said Christoph Erk@@ ens , chairman of " Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ehrt sich . "
The current state of affairs : the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; approval from the regional government is still pending .
Erk@@ ens : " Gran@@ t of approval for the construction of wind turbin@@ es on this site is therefore prec@@ lu@@ ded by planning law . "
The district confirms receipt of the call for action .
" The relevant correspon@@ dence was received by the district of Vier@@ sen in the last week , " declared a spo@@ kes@@ person .
The district is taking it as a reason to investigate the matter af@@ res@@ h .
However , it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings .
With a view to the proceedings under@@ way at the administrative court , the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association " Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ehrt sich . "
NEW R@@ e , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning construction of four wind turbin@@ es , each 200 metres high , on a plot by Bo@@ sh@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
The company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen holds indirect participating interests , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65 @@@ -@@ @ hec@@ t@@ are site last year already .
The construction of the four wind turbin@@ es should cover the energy requirements of around 11,@@ 400 households - that equ@@ ates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Vier@@ sen households .
NEW R@@ e wants to invest around 20 million euros .
Last summer , Vier@@ sen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbin@@ es in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach@@ pal@@ enberg in the district of H@@ eins@@ berg .
Car and trac@@ tor cra@@ sh together : woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10@@ am on the L 33@@ 3 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rh@@ ein @@@ -@@ @ L@@ ahn district ) .
In it , a woman was fat@@ ally in@@ ju@@ red .
Two other people were m@@ ild@@ ly in@@ ju@@ red .
The road remained closed for hours .
According to police information , a 17 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , practi@@ sing accompanied driving in her car with her 53 @@@ -@@ @ year old mother , the accompanying driver , was using the L 33@@ 3 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
Town and dealers plan " hom@@ et@@ own shopping " weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ z@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September .
The trade association and town authorities want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th September to enti@@ ce residents to a shopping spre@@ e in the town centre .
As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced , the " home @@@ -@@ @ town shopping " weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual super@@ market goods .
A market with local suppliers is thus planned , similar to the weekly market .
In addition , hom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wn companies are to give show@@ cases , with their app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip places .
Furthermore , the businesses in the town centre are to invite people to come " mid@@ night shopping . "
The campaign is not only for residents of the town and the nearby region .
Ad@@ ver@@ ts on the radio , an online video and printed bags that all@@ ude to the campaign weekend are in preparation , Christian König tells us .
Town authorities and the trade association are co@@ operating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the " attractive town centre " project .
To this belong new offer@@ ings such as the first " active day " for the fo@@ untain festival along with Sunday trading , talks with all the tra@@ ders and propri@@ et@@ ors to in@@ duce people to actively participate .
At@@ trac@@ tive offers on the Saturday and wai@@ ving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
In addition , new and existing customer bases can be developed .
This includes spa guests and tourists .
But many loc@@ als too had lost sight of the town centre for shopping .
Ul@@ timately , it all has to contribute to brea@@ thing life into the town centre - right up to land@@ l@@ ords , businesses across the whole town and associations .
We have to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that has partly built up , König had said in the spring .
Brig@@ it St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in M@@ ühl@@ hausen communic@@ ated that five Th@@ ür@@ ingen towns are taking part in the nation 's third " hom@@ et@@ own shopping " day .
Al@@ ongside Bad Lag@@ ens@@ al@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ li@@ gen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
The day is intended to " promote appreciation for local trade and emphasise more strongly its importance for the common good of our towns , " said St@@ reich .
The campaign , under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners , also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour .

Trump pres@@ su@@ red Mexico on border wall payment according to le@@ aked phone call tran@@ scripts
Tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been le@@ aked by the Washington Post .
On 27@@ th January in a phone call to Mexican president , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to , Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
The US President ber@@ ated him for publicly den@@ ounc@@ ing the wall , re@@ porte@@ dly saying to him " You cannot say that to the press . "
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vo@@ wed to make Mexico pay for the project .
Tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l were also published reve@@ aling a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr Trump told Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was " ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , " " ro@@ tten " and " st@@ up@@ id , " insi@@ sting the deal , bro@@ k@@ ered under the Obama administration , would make him look like " a d@@ ope " after he had proposed a ban on refugee res@@ ett@@ lement in the US .
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l " this is the most un@@ pleasant call all day . "
Mo@@ ore 's Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : Ac@@ tivi@@ sts Re@@ en@@ act Rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of on@@ loo@@ kers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and ru@@ m@@ bled toward the small Mo@@ ore 's Ford Bridge .
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with g@@ uns step@@ ped forward to block its path .
The leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long dra@@ g on his ci@@ gar and pe@@ ered through the wind@@ shi@@ eld .
In@@ side , the occup@@ ants re@@ eled in fear .
" We want that n-@@ --@@ -@@ r Roger ! " the man bark@@ ed .
" Get him out of the car ! "
Scre@@ ams ri@@ pped through the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged from the front passenger seat .
Fort@@ un@@ ately , this hor@@ ri@@ fic scene , which played out on July 22 , is just a re@@ en@@ act@@ ment .
But when a no@@ ose is thro@@ wn around the neck of " Roger , " nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gas@@ ps .
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the Mo@@ ore 's Ford Bridge to recre@@ ate the night two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were l@@ yn@@ ched by the K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
No one has ever been charged with the mur@@ ders .
" It 's mind bo@@ gg@@ ling that all of these years , not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities ; even though we know who they are , " said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organize the re@@ en@@ act@@ ment .
" It 's a stain on a history , but it 's a burden on our sou@@ ls . "
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old former Georgia state con@@ gres@@ s@@ man and li@@ felong civil rights activ@@ ist .
For him , the re@@ en@@ act@@ ment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual remin@@ der to the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an in@@ justice has never been correc@@ ted .
" We want prosec@@ ution , we want closure , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but we have to have justice first , " he said .
" We can 't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . "
A cor@@ oner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore 's Ford l@@ yn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
According to F@@ BI files obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were susp@@ ected in the l@@ yn@@ ching .
But not one was ever prosec@@ uted .
Th@@ ough the susp@@ ects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say the twin mo@@ tiv@@ ations for the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings were always well known throughout town : politics and sex .
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast bal@@ lots for the first time during the primary race later that summer .
Around the same time of the election , according to the F@@ BI , black sha@@ rec@@ rop@@ per Roger Mal@@ com stab@@ bed Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ ester , a white land@@ owner , during a fight - o@@ sten@@ sibly over a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the town ru@@ m@@ or was that H@@ ester had been sleeping with Mal@@ com 's wife , Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband 's .
On July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to b@@ ail Mal@@ com out of j@@ ail , according to the F@@ BI .
He was accompanied to the prison by Dor@@ oth@@ y , and their cou@@ sins , Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
But , driving away from the j@@ ail , as they appro@@ ached Mo@@ ore 's Ford Bridge , a l@@ yn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
" As it turns out it was Har@@ rison who set up and ordered the mur@@ ders , " one F@@ BI report conclu@@ des .
" It is also apparent that there was a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy among state and local law enforcement , who not only took part in the mur@@ ders , dispo@@ sed of evidence and conc@@ e@@ aled the identity of wit@@ nesses . "
Broo@@ ks put it more succ@@ inc@@ tly .
" It was a voting rights mass@@ ac@@ re , " he said .
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , this is what will happen to you . ' "
For nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual re@@ en@@ act@@ ment of the Mo@@ ore 's Ford Bridge l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings .
Her performance is graphic , gri@@ pping and ground@@ ed in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .
It 's difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that 's the point .
" We don 't want to talk about the l@@ yn@@ ching because it makes us face the ug@@ liness in all of us , " she said .
" But I can 't build a relationship with you , if you won 't hear me , or hear what I 've been through . "
Reh@@ ear@@ s@@ als for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a do@@ zen white and the rest black - crow@@ ded into a room and listen@@ ed as Gre@@ ene launched into a well @@@ -@@ @ re@@ hear@@ sed overview of the play .
W@@ ade Marb@@ au@@ gh serves as Gre@@ ene 's co @@@ -@@ @ director .
He 's played the part of the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man for years , but he said the role never gets any easier .
" I feel dir@@ ty because this is not who I am , " said Marb@@ au@@ gh .
" But I think it 's very important to keep this history alive because we don 't want to go back to those times . "
Across the room , actors Dar@@ ri@@ us Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w and N@@ ick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ ester , re@@ hear@@ sed their lines .
The play begins with Mal@@ com sh@@ ou@@ ting and sho@@ ving H@@ ester , li@@ vi@@ d that he 's been sleeping with his wife , Dor@@ oth@@ y .
" I said n-@@ --@@ a , get off my property ! "
Ras@@ cona fires back .
There 's a beat .
And then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) bur@@ sts into lau@@ ghter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh@@ s the har@@ dest .
" What ? ! , " Ras@@ cona asked .
He 's al@@ armed , conf@@ used .
Di@@ d I go too hard ?
" No , " Gre@@ ene said through ch@@ u@@ ck@@ les .
" I just don 't think white people back then said ' n-@@ --@@ a . ' "
" Y@@ ea , " one of the other black cast members qui@@ pped .
" You have to hit the hard ' R. ' "
And just like that the energy in the room shi@@ fts ; a sense of cam@@ ar@@ a@@ der@@ ie re@@ places the dis@@ comfort .
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right , not only for the sake of the play , but also for the memory of the four people killed .
The scene begins again .
This time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @@@ -@@ @ word , it 's sharp and em@@ ph@@ atic .
Absol@@ utely no one lau@@ gh@@ s .
The re@@ en@@ act@@ ment ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
There 's scre@@ ams , g@@ un@@ fire and then , silence .
A woman dres@@ sed in f@@ uner@@ al black , stands over the actors bodies and perform@@ s Billi@@ e Holiday 's mo@@ ur@@ n@@ ful eu@@ logy , " St@@ range Fru@@ it . "
Her voice breaks on every other word .
A hundred yards back , a group of about four do@@ zen spec@@ t@@ ators wipe swe@@ at and te@@ ars away from their eyes .
The audience is almost ev@@ enly split between black and white .
One couple has travel@@ ed from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many are from just down the road .
They 've all we@@ a@@ ther@@ ed Georgia 's op@@ pres@@ sive hum@@ idity for the nearly eight hours as Broo@@ ks lead them on a pilgri@@ mage to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
Up until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te , but now , standing on the same land where the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings took place , the air feels ha@@ un@@ ted .
As the final notes of the song f@@ ade , Gre@@ ene invites the crow@@ d to move closer and insp@@ ect the bodies .
Children c@@ rou@@ ch by their heads , take in the f@@ ake blood and still bodies , and wh@@ is@@ per to each other .
" They 're not really dead , " one little boy mut@@ ters , as if to remind himself .
After a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crow@@ d , and suddenly it 's over .
The actors throw off the l@@ yn@@ ching rop@@ e and wipe away te@@ ars .
Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Marb@@ au@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man .
N@@ ick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his cast@@ m@@ ates , and then breaks down cr@@ ying in their arms ; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him .
" It 's ok@@ ay , " one of the women wh@@ is@@ pers .
" We know that 's not what 's in your heart .
You did this for a reason . "
L@@ ater , the audience si@@ ts down to dinner with the actors .
At one table , a white couple from Atlan@@ ta ch@@ ats anim@@ at@@ edly about the re@@ en@@ act@@ ment with a black couple they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski strugg@@ led to find words for how the performance made her feel .
" It 's hard to hear those hor@@ ri@@ ble aw@@ ful words , and de@@ eds .@@ .. come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .
" What this really does to me is make me think that l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings are still going on , " she added , " they 're just called police sho@@ ot@@ ings now . "
Across the room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , eating and remin@@ is@@ cing about civil rights .
He said he 's already begun planning for next year 's performance .
" The re@@ en@@ act@@ ment is in@@ spir@@ ational in a way because it describes the hor@@ ror of what we endu@@ red , but it also is a teaching moment , " he said .
" It 's like , if you don 't learn from this , it can happen again .
Those who don 't study their history , those who do not know their history , are do@@ om@@ ed to repeat it . "
" Gö@@ tter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung " pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ates Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner 's monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf again foc@@ usses on a colour@@ ful and fri@@ vol@@ ous production , set against a giant , six @@@ -@@ @ sto@@ rey back@@ drop .
The revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , complete with remains of the Wall and k@@ eb@@ ab shop in Berlin , a " Pla@@ ste und E@@ la@@ ste " logo from the D@@ DR times , or the New York stock exchange .
In front is par@@ ked an open v@@ intage Mercedes car , in which the Rhin@@ em@@ ai@@ dens pose like ro@@ cker girls , or altern@@ atively , an Is@@ etta .
St@@ acked oil bar@@ rel@@ s are remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ orf 's leit@@ mo@@ tif - gold , power and gre@@ ed - that runs through his production of the " Ring . "
The three Rhin@@ em@@ ai@@ dens - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexand@@ ra St@@ einer - work wonder@@ fully together , as they did already in " Rhein@@ gold . "
They sau@@ c@@ ily se@@ duce Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , lu@@ g a body in the boot in Hollywood manner , and play the ri@@ ot@@ ous cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the part of the super@@ bly n@@ asty Ha@@ gen , who has the au@@ ra of a heavy @@@ -@@ @ weight bo@@ x@@ er .
The scene where he sla@@ ys Sieg@@ fried is brutal .
L@@ ater , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) c@@ ops it too .
The audience thanks the ensemble with mi@@ ghty appl@@ ause .
There is a rap@@ tu@@ rous reception for Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ ow@@ ski , who eff@@ aces himself and bo@@ ws his hands , forming a Merkel diam@@ ond .
There is huge appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , who appear on stage for the first time - in cas@@ ual lei@@ su@@ re@@ wear in view of the high heat .
The performance from Frank Cast@@ orf and his direc@@ ting team had been awa@@ ited with exc@@ it@@ ement .
Even if in 2013 he had had to end@@ ure another hall full of sh@@ ri@@ ll cat@@ calls , five years later there were great che@@ ers , which dro@@ wn@@ ed out the isolated boo@@ s .
Festival head Katharina Wagner will likely have been delighted .
" Once can see that the audience has in some way grown into the " Ring , " " she had said shortly before the performance from the d@@ pa .
The audience has not only made a kind of peace with Cast@@ orf , but on top of that , an understanding for his point of view has grown .
I see positive results .

Menge : Norm@@ ally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , and once a week I help out here in Gre@@ ven in the Mö@@ bel@@ brücke .
And I have also worked at the full @@@ -@@ @ day school in their supplementary activities .
What are your experiences of that ?
Menge : It is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I deal with different people : with ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , with refugees , with young adults .
You are 26 years old now , so a volunte@@ er with a late @@@ -@@ @ calling .
How did that come about ?
Menge : I did my Ab@@ it@@ ur exam@@ s .
And then I successfully abandoned , shall we say , a civil engineering course of studies .
I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else , work with people .
And then I asked myself , what do you do ?
Do a social year , you can get an insight , can see what it is really like on site , in the thick of things too perhaps .
And was it like that ?
Menge : I gathered great insi@@ ghts .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter sem@@ ester .
I will study in dual , probably do an app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip as a welfare worker at the Her@@ ne child protective services and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service ?
Menge : Yes , it is very variable .
It always depends on where one is doing their voluntary service year .
One can do it from at the old people 's home right up to in youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
In my case , it was very varied .
I was also sometimes at the open full @@@ -@@ @ day schools , that is , for the afternoon care .
For me that was exactly the right thing , the thing that got me fi@@ red up .
I was able to recognise and see my own streng@@ ths , as it was really happening .
Differ@@ ently from when doing the civil engineering studies ?
Menge : Y@@ e@@ ah , sure ; here it 's not about working out statistics .
One always has other people at the front of their minds , people who all have totally different hist@@ ories behind them .
Whether it 's a refugee or an ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent who has been pul@@ led out of their family - you always have to approach it individually .
Very interesting .
And they didn 't have any fear of contact ?
Menge : I 'm not the kind of gu@@ y for that .
It is an area that gives one a lot .
A lot of love , a lot of friend@@ liness .
There are negative moments too sometimes , but that 's just life .
P@@ ear@@ son cuts another 3,@@ 000 jobs , s@@ las@@ hes divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
British education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday it would cut another 3,@@ 000 jobs and s@@ lash its interim divi@@ dend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business .
The job cuts , which Chief Executive John Fall@@ on said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019 , are in addition to 4,@@ 000 roles lost in its previous restructuring .
P@@ ear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million po@@ unds ( $ 3@@ 94 @@@ -@@ @ million U.S. ) in May in a third cost @@@ -@@ @ cutting programme to try to revi@@ ve a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .
The company , which agreed to sell its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann last month , said its out@@ look for the year was un@@ changed after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.@@ 05 billion po@@ unds .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : Nat@@ o soldi@@ er killed in su@@ ici@@ de bl@@ ast
A su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber has att@@ acked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afghan capital , Kab@@ ul , killing a Nat@@ o soldi@@ er and wo@@ und@@ ing several others , officials say .
Five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were in@@ ju@@ red , a Nat@@ o statement said .
Un@@ confirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city 's Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
The bom@@ bing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que bl@@ ast in Her@@ at .
On Monday a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi em@@ bass@@ y in Kab@@ ul .
A Nat@@ o statement said that Thursday evening 's bl@@ ast happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was att@@ acked by a " personnel @@@ -@@ @ borne impro@@ vised explo@@ sive device . "
The statement said that all those in@@ ju@@ red are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
Cor@@ respon@@ dents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so @@@ -@@ @ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major source of concern to Nat@@ o forces based in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
According to the United Nations , Afghanistan saw at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017 , with about 20 % of those in the capital .
At the end of July , a su@@ ici@@ de car bom@@ b killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ a district of Kab@@ ul .
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack .
On 31 May , a huge bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people , the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since US @@@ -@@ @ led forces ou@@ sted the Taliban from power in 2001 .
The violence underlines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weigh@@ s up whether to increase the number of US troops ai@@ ding the military and police in the country .
Cor@@ respon@@ dents say the su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ han@@ i .
EPA rever@@ ses decision to delay smo@@ g rule after law@@ su@@ its
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rever@@ sed a decision to delay an Obama @@@ -@@ @ era rule requiring states to cur@@ b smo@@ g @@@ -@@ @ causing emissions , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency over the move .
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so @@@ -@@ @ called " 2015 O@@ zone Design@@ ations " late on Wednesday , saying it showed the agency 's commitment to working with states .
" We believe in dialogue with , and being respon@@ sive to , our state partners , " EPA Chief Sco@@ tt P@@ ru@@ itt said in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt in June had announced the EPA 's intention to delay the o@@ zone design@@ ations - in which existing smo@@ g pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tou@@ gh@@ er air quality standard - by one year to October 2018 .
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states , along with the District of Columbia , filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal .
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at spark@@ ing economic growth .
But the efforts have trig@@ ger@@ ed push@@ back by Demo@@ crati@@ cs and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
The EPA 's website says brea@@ thing air containing o@@ zone " can reduce lung function and increase resp@@ ir@@ atory symptoms " like as@@ th@@ ma .
Municip@@ al council wants common room
In the end , the decision was clear : with two dis@@ sent@@ ing votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @@@ -@@ @ Win@@ zeln passed a resolution for a common room in the future retirement home .
A@@ head of the debate , there is an important piece of information to be had : the purchase contract for the as yet still needed plot section has been signed , reports may@@ or Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
Ad@@ mit@@ tedly it will still be a while until the plot , which up until now has belon@@ ged to the church parish , comes into the possession of the municipality , but nevertheless , there are now no longer any planning obstacles for the project that has to be materi@@ alised by a private investor .
That is why there is a debate concerning a common room .
One of the two investors that are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality .
For a special price , it would provide a living space - of around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with no less than 70 square metres on the ground floor .
What the management and the majority of the municipal council have in mind is not simply to set aside such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior citizens ' accommodation , but for it to be open to the community .
Tal@@ k of a " k@@ nit@@ ting caf@@ é " was making the round@@ s , for example .
The decision , which was already p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ determined last Aut@@ umn through the allocation of resources for the current budget , is swe@@ et@@ ened by funding opportunities .
The building is in an area for re@@ development .
The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support , reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 per cent .
So as to signal to the investor that no @@@ -@@ @ one wants to put a spoke in their wheel , the proposed resolution makes allow@@ ances for the determination that both a s@@ add@@ led roof - based on the surrounding buildings - and a mon@@ o @@@ -@@ @ pit@@ ch roof - which reduces the height of the e@@ aves and makes the building more economical - would be possible .
An un@@ ec@@ c@@ ess@@ ary addition , thinks not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer .
If it helps : it passes through the committee unanimously .
It 's not so easy with the common room .
Daniel@@ a Ruf points to their many owned buildings that are not really being for@@ ged ahead , but instead they are going out of their way with the common room : " I have difficulty with that , " she says .
Y@@ von@@ ne St@@ ai@@ ger decla@@ res herself to be un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally in favour of the common room - but absolutely against an investment from the municipality .
She views that as a hidden sub@@ sid@@ y to already we@@ al@@ thy , or even foreign , investors .
That is simply not true according to the counter@@ argument , for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants , but are rather getting a genuine , when in doubt sal@@ eable , equivalent in value .
St@@ ai@@ ger 's proposal , to split up the proposed resolution accordingly , has three supporters .
So , with two dis@@ sent@@ ing votes , they are sti@@ cking with the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ed up as follows : " If we pass the resolution as so , we make a huge step towards plu@@ gging a huge gap in our infrastructure . "
Col@@ li@@ sion with a car : Cy@@ cli@@ st hur@@ led onto the road
The 82 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old cy@@ cli@@ st was hit by a car whilst crossing the road in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and was seriously in@@ ju@@ red .

FC Bayern Munich have to do without David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago for the Super Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
The Super Cup is happening without him : David Al@@ aba has to ski@@ p the game against Dortmund .
With squ@@ ad concerns , FC Bayern are travelling to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season .
The title @@@ -@@ @ def@@ ender is missing seven of its pro@@ s in the Super Cup against the cup winners .
The squ@@ ad concerns are getting even bigger for the German football record champi@@ ons Bayern Munich ahead of the Super Cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30@@ pm / Z@@ DF and Euro@@ sport ) at cup winners Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
Co@@ ach Carlo An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti has to also do without David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
The Italian confirmed that on Friday .
In addition , the Munich team is missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti bl@@ amed the physical state of his team and the lack of balance in their game for their five defe@@ ats in the past six friend@@ lies .
" We know that we are not in the best physical condition , " said An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti , adding , " The most important point is the balance in the team .
That has not been good recently . "
However , the 58 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old believes that they can improve their performance in the first official competitive game of the season .
" Football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team exhi@@ bits these qualities .
The team is ready .
We want to play intellig@@ ently , " said An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti , who is exp@@ ecting a " difficult , intense game . "
The du@@ el between the two German football heav@@ y@@ wei@@ ghts is cap@@ tiv@@ ating the fans .
With 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spec@@ t@@ ators , the game is sold out , shared the German football le@@ ague ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
Wander@@ ing from star to star in the Har@@ z
The nation 's first " ast@@ ral path " is to come to life in the Har@@ z .
It is being planned by the San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg Ob@@ servatory society .
There has been a plan@@ etary trail in Gött@@ ingen since 2003 .
An " ast@@ ral path " satis@@ fies many Har@@ z visitors ' need for information , it is said .
It combines nature , science , exercise and ath@@ le@@ tic performance .
Members want to set up pla@@ ques along the planned route and put information about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations on them .
In a first phase , until 2018 , the association is planning " easily accessible installations in five to six locations " in the Upper Har@@ z .
In the running are St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ h@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ e@@ ber .
The information on the pla@@ ques is to be expanded upon online .
So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations .
Acces@@ sibility is also a criterion .
The ast@@ ral path is later to be extended , step by step .
" Spec@@ t@@ ators will gain lots of useful knowledge on the ast@@ ral path , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the society .
In addition , they will learn why stars have different colours , or why one star sh@@ ines more brigh@@ tly than another , although it is significantly further away .
It will also teach which con@@ stell@@ ation a selected star is located in , and when the best time to see it is .
The society has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany , in the small mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , since 2014 already .
The location in the middle of the Har@@ z national park is among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany , according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Con@@ servation .
One can regularly clearly see the Mil@@ ky Way , and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy , from there with n@@ aked eyes .
The university town , on the initiative of the Gött@@ ingen Planet@@ arium friends ' association , has had something similar to the ast@@ ral path since 2013 - the plan@@ etary trail .
Starting at Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle , which forms the centre of our solar system , the plan@@ etary trail leads with its st@@ el@@ es up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an " extra @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ restri@@ al " location in Di@@ em@@ ar@@ den ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet S@@ ed@@ na .
The st@@ el@@ es with the individual plan@@ ets - including Plu@@ to , which was down@@ gra@@ ded to a d@@ war@@ f planet , at the end point - are set up at exact inter@@ vals and on a scale of one to two billion .
The Earth thus shr@@ in@@ ks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ metres , while the sun , standing exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
The total distance covered by the plan@@ etary trail is a good four kilometres .
While the light of the sun needs around eight hours to reach Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to get to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
So , pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in space .
The tre@@ k to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ li@@ sion course to stage the most comp@@ elling bo@@ x@@ ing match under 147 po@@ unds in the near future , met each other for the first time Thursday .
They were in separate rooms at ES@@ P@@ N offices in Los Angeles until Gar@@ cia , the unbe@@ aten World Box@@ ing Council light@@ weight champi@@ on , wal@@ ked down the h@@ all@@ way to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organization super @@@ -@@ @ fe@@ a@@ ther@@ weight champi@@ on .
After Gar@@ cia 's victory by unanim@@ ous decision over former four @@@ -@@ @ division world champi@@ on Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time , both fi@@ ghters are members of the top @@@ -@@ @ five po@@ und @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ po@@ und list .
Gar@@ cia extended his right hand and said , " How you doing , cham@@ p ?
Best of luck to you . "
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 on ES@@ P@@ N .
As the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager E@@ g@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a potential show@@ down between the fi@@ ghters would be " perfect si@@ zing . "
" I 'm a former fe@@ a@@ ther@@ weight , " Gar@@ cia remin@@ ded .
" I moved up for Bron@@ er [ at 140 po@@ unds ] , but I 'm not that big .
I 'm small for 140 .
I want to come down to light@@ weight .
And he 's got to move up to light@@ weight [ 135 po@@ unds ] and then we have a fight .
That 's what the fans are asking for .
Let 's give them that . "
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
" Box@@ ing needs this fight . "
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @@@ -@@ @ per @@@ -@@ @ view , part of a strategy he has to have Lom@@ ach@@ enko fight a 135 @@@ -@@ @ po@@ und debut b@@ out later this year to set up a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @@@ -@@ @ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has interest in fighting the Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @@@ -@@ @ Lu@@ ke Camp@@ bell winner following their S@@ ept . 23 light@@ weight title b@@ out at the Forum .
" This fight could be on pay @@@ -@@ @ per @@@ -@@ @ view because all the fans have been asking about it , " Gar@@ cia said , later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package .
" We 're the main names .
No other names can generate that kind of attention .
W@@ hen@@ ever they 're ready .@@ .. . "
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as " a tremendous fi@@ ghter , " and may attend his Saturday b@@ out .
But Lom@@ ach@@ enko p@@ aus@@ ed at la@@ v@@ ish pra@@ ise for Gar@@ cia , saying he thought the three @@@ -@@ @ division champi@@ on from Ri@@ versi@@ de looked " very slow , sorry Mi@@ key .@@ .. you wanted the kno@@ ck@@ out . "
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show pun@@ ching strength , then box .
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own b@@ out .
" This is the fight to be made .
No other fight creates as much attention and bu@@ z@@ z .
I 'm more than happy to work at it , " Gar@@ cia said .
S@@ aid Lom@@ ach@@ enko : " I 've wa@@ ited for the top fi@@ ghters , and this is Mi@@ key .
It will be a great fight . "
Four in@@ ju@@ red after bur@@ st ty@@ re
In an accident on the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon , four people were in@@ ju@@ red , some sever@@ ely .
According to initial reports , the driver of an Opel Z@@ ai@@ f@@ ra lost control of his vehicle at around 4.@@ 30@@ pm , shortly before the Markt@@ breit junction , after a bur@@ st ty@@ re .
The car sli@@ d right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then lay on its roof , on the grass ver@@ ge .
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were , in part , sever@@ ely in@@ ju@@ red in the accident .
While first aid was being given to the in@@ ju@@ red by the emergency services , the A@@ 7 was closed for around an hour in the nor@@ ther@@ ly direction , before traffic was able to be led round the site of the accident in the left lan@@ e .
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoff@@ mann : " Three at the back works better "
And@@ re Hoff@@ mann hopes after the 2 : 2 to k@@ ick off the season against Braun@@ schwei@@ g that the optim@@ isation of the defence formation will bring points in Au@@ e .
And@@ re Hoff@@ mann was content with the first game of the season , and with the result too , were it not for the two own goals in the 2 : 2 against Braun@@ schwei@@ g .
" That was two own goals too many , and in Au@@ e , we have to take better care still , " says the def@@ ender from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
The line of three at the back is to be optim@@ ised even further in the Or@@ e mountains .
And the Fort@@ un@@ as don 't want to let in any more goals after free ki@@ cks either .
" In future , no @@@ -@@ @ one will stand on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) any more . "
Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team man@@ ages better with the three @@@ -@@ @ at @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ back formation , even after the experiences in the build @@@ -@@ @ up .
" I don 't know yet how we will play in Au@@ e , " said the coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Ho@@ ach@@ mann is sure of himself , " because in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well , " said Hoff@@ mann .
" However , a prerequisite is that we harmon@@ ise even better together and don 't commit so many passing errors in the build up . "
Natur@@ ally , Hoff@@ mann is also travelling to Au@@ e to win the game .
" Whether after one draw though one can talk of a failed start , I don 't know .
The performance could by all means be ok@@ ay , " said Hoff@@ mann .
" However , if we 're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we 'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season k@@ ick @@@ -@@ @ off . "
His coach didn 't want to hear any of that .
" I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches , " said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the Sax@@ ony team 's game in Hei@@ den@@ hel@@ m had to be cut @@@ -@@ @ off early due to a stor@@ m .
" Now they are effectively able to start the season with a home game , " said Funk@@ el , and Hoff@@ man believes that the players from Au@@ e could perhaps even be somewhat fres@@ her , since they don 't have any difficult and full games like Fort@@ una against one of the promotion favour@@ ites re@@ sting in their b@@ ones .
" But they don 't know 100 per cent where they stand at the moment , " says the Fort@@ una central def@@ ender .
Ad@@ mit@@ tedly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally ( almost ) finished Au@@ e stadium as slight favour@@ ites .
" That we are going to swe@@ ep them away just because we can claim a place amongst the top six is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , " says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet against Au@@ e , with only one defeat in nine games , is thoroughly positive .
" There is no team in the second Bundes@@ lig@@ a that one has to beat from the outset , " explains Fort@@ una 's head coach .
" To give such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous . "
And Funk@@ el does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday .
New results of Sweden 's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medi@@ cally assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were jud@@ ged to be older than 18 , but not everyone has faith in their accuracy .
Sweden 's national For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started carrying out the tests earlier year .
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migrations@@ verk@@ et ) was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for fail@@ ings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claim@@ ing to be under@@ age .
To date Migrations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested , and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period between mid March until July 3@@ 1st , 2017 .
Ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were jud@@ ged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency jud@@ ged that the subject was " possibly 18 or over . "
In 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 . "
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person 's age is in question .
According to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
" We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , " he told The Local .
The high proportion of cases jud@@ ged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about their age .
In May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 inst@@ ances that " suggest the person examined is 18 years or older . "
When newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results released however it found that in 24@@ 3 of the cases the person had op@@ enly stated that they turn 18 this year .
The method of medical age assessment , which consists of taking X @@@ -@@ @ rays of wisdom teeth and M@@ RI sc@@ ans of k@@ nee jo@@ ints , then having denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists analyse them , has also been critic@@ ised in some quarters .
One sc@@ ep@@ tic is Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Mar@@ cus , whose work includes assessing the biological mat@@ urity of people to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier or later than usual .
" I 've had reason to think about this , and I don 't think the type of measurement being used should be .
Ju@@ dging biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
If we can 't say it for sure we sh@@ ouldn 't pre@@ tend that we can , " he told newspaper Metro .
The For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency 's Gö@@ ran@@ sson def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests however : " In general you can say that the risk of in@@ accur@@ ately jud@@ ging a child to be an adult is small .
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it 's around 10 percent . "
Right on target
The works on the three bridges of the L 108 road , between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , are progres@@ sing well .
On Wednesday , a seven @@@ -@@ @ ton@@ ne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
" We 're doing very well for time - it 's going great , " says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government .
In April , works began on all three bridges in need of refur@@ bish@@ ment between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach at the same time .
The works are scheduled to be completed in October , and Lei@@ cht is certain that the timetable will be stu@@ ck to .
The first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
It is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete that is covered in red vari@@ eg@@ ated sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
It was built in 1900 .
Like the other two bridges , it is old by now .
In order to ensure their stability and road safety , the three structures now have to be thoroughly renovated .
The two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
They are made of vari@@ eg@@ ated sand@@ stone .
Both were er@@ ected in 1939 and they are twelve and 10.@@ 60 metres high , respectively .
The bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now - as of Wednesday morning - been given a 1.@@ 30 @@@ -@@ @ met@@ re @@@ -@@ @ wide and seven @@@ -@@ @ ton@@ ne @@@ -@@ @ heavy so @@@ -@@ @ called bridge par@@ ap@@ et on its north side .
This fi@@ xes the bound@@ ary and is also used as a passenger path .
A 2.@@ 20 @@@ -@@ @ met@@ re @@@ -@@ @ wide bridge par@@ ap@@ et is to be put in place on the south part of the bridge on Friday .
The pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is intended to then to run over that .
What is special about this is that is uses finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ra@@ mberg company Di@@ zw@@ o .
The other two bridges are already kit@@ ted out with the pat@@ ented bridge par@@ ap@@ ets .
Lay@@ ing cables through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach required particular fla@@ ir .
For a fi@@ b@@ reg@@ lass cable also runs there , which many companies are connected to .
In the run @@@ -@@ @ up to the works , residents were informed about the project via a le@@ af@@ let .
F@@ ish and cra@@ bs must also be fish@@ ed out first .
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the lake reser@@ vo@@ ir in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is single @@@ -@@ @ lan@@ e and regulated by lights .
For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , the road in the area of the bridge , where the " T@@ ann@@ en@@ hof " and " Si@@ eben Lin@@ den " hotels are , is fully closed .

Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : Colo@@ ur@@ ful protest with German pot@@ ato sal@@ ad
It doesn 't happen that often that parties pull together , but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , people come together who would otherwise be difficult to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le .
The parties who represent in the Vul@@ kan Ei@@ fel district council ( CD@@ U , SP@@ D , the Greens , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , die Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that is peac@@ efully n@@ ailing its colours to the m@@ ast on this day because the Af@@ D are holding a " big k@@ ick @@@ -@@ @ off to the election campaign " in Ger@@ ol@@ stein Town Hall pla@@ za .
And are launching famous names - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land makes up the leading du@@ o for the Bun@@ de@@ stag elections on 24@@ th September , and the federal dep@@ uty chair@@ woman , Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
But those who have been on site for hours already before the start of the event don 't want to listen to the Af@@ D , but rather , demonstrate .
The motto : " Ei@@ fel is staying colour@@ ful . "
Origin@@ ally the town pic@@ nic was planned for Br@@ unn@@ en@@ platz square under the motto " everyone at one table , " but now is taking place in the car@@ park bene@@ ath the shopping pla@@ za - and therefore directly in sight of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Town Hall .
A colour@@ ful picture on show there .
And what really delighted Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ person of the Eine Welt ( One World ) Forum and one of the leading organis@@ ers : " It 's great how many people have come together here . "
There 's music and all sor@@ ts of food , including a " typical German pot@@ ato sal@@ ad " that even the Af@@ D would have no problem eating , " said the woman who had brought it .
The police had sum@@ mon@@ ed lots of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein and were above all also present at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the event locations .
How did the Af@@ D make it to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , actually ?
Mario H@@ omp@@ e from the Vul@@ kan Ei@@ fel Af@@ D reports that he stro@@ ve hard to get such an event and that he won the contract .
The 45 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ der@@ sdorf had originally in@@ qui@@ red in Dau@@ n , but had got a no there because there were not enough parking places available due to the St. Law@@ rence fun@@ fair already being set up .
So now , the shopping pla@@ za ; H@@ omp@@ es is delighted that " we are able to hold such a wonderful event here . "
With a view to the event on the pla@@ za fore@@ court he says : " It 's the people 's right . The main this is that it stays peaceful . "
And it does : at around 8@@ pm some entertainment is provided , by a band on the pla@@ za fore@@ court , and in the town hall , by various speakers , including Rhin@@ eland @@@ -@@ @ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman U@@ we Junge .
In the hall there are about 200 in att@@ end@@ ance , waiting for the leading candidate for the Bun@@ de@@ stag elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the federal dep@@ uty chair@@ woman , Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch , to give their speeches .
The police presence is un@@ changed , but until now the officials have had a quiet evening .
The Af@@ D event la@@ sts a little more than an hour ; the guests in the fore@@ court have a long wind , but even there it is time to clear up shortly after 9@@ pm .
The police can go away - no specific inci@@ dents .
Tro@@ mb@@ one meets tru@@ mp@@ et
There is another chance to hear Wol@@ fach tro@@ mb@@ on@@ ist Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i in the series of Has@@ lach clo@@ i@@ ster concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
Together with the Bulgarian tru@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he is giving a concert that carries the s@@ logan " The Black Sea meets the Black Forest , " or even , " Balkan fol@@ kl@@ ore " meets a classic German education with roots in bra@@ ss music .
Both s@@ olo@@ ists are winners and awar@@ de@@ es of numerous international competitions and hold s@@ olo@@ ist positions in leading European orchest@@ ras .
So , Pet@@ kov is solo tru@@ mp@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra in Amsterdam , and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is solo tro@@ mb@@ on@@ ist with the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
Both have in common a passion not only for tran@@ sc@@ ending the boundaries of their instruments but also for conf@@ lating the boundaries of the various gen@@ res .
So , Johann Sebastian Bach played by the two of them takes on a whole new sound , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der 's " Welt@@ musik " un@@ ites with Bulgarian fol@@ kl@@ ore , and in the piece " Exchange Su@@ its " from J@@ azz@@ E@@ cho prize @@@ -@@ @ winner N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , they bl@@ end classical , jazz and free play into a fascinating complete art work .
This cent@@ re@@ piece of the programme had its debut performance in Freiburg this spring , to great success .
The renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram wrote it especially for the two musicians and there 's more : the Has@@ lach monastery church , with its special acoustic , was consci@@ ously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
" Some people love gri@@ ll@@ ed cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives .
But I want to try everything . " This is what Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart said in total frank@@ ness on the topic of her bis@@ exu@@ ality .
" If I b@@ ite into gri@@ ll@@ ed cheese once , I think , ' O@@ h , that was cool , what 's next ? ' . "
The Hollywood star 's most famous relationship was probably that with her " T@@ wi@@ light " co @@@ -@@ @ star Robert P@@ att@@ inson , which came apart bit@@ terly in the end .
Despite all that , the brunette actress assu@@ res " Har@@ per 's B@@ az@@ aar " magazine : " I 've been deeply in love with everyone I 've dated .
Or did you think I was fak@@ ing it ? "
After their split , Kri@@ sten came out as bis@@ ex@@ ual : " I 've always really lived for that du@@ ality and seriously believed in it .
It has never conf@@ used me or held me back .
I just never liked being made fun of . "
She suffered from this especially in her school days , according to " B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , " when she preferred to dress like a boy : " Not all girls are typical girls .
That really , really h@@ urt me .
When I was el@@ even , kids told me I looked like a boy .
I felt really att@@ acked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and ash@@ amed .
Now I look back and think : ' Girl , be proud of yourself ! ' . "
She particularly doesn 't like expla@@ ining her love life to the public : " People expect you to be@@ have in a certain way , and that makes me an@@ gr@@ y .
And maybe some people call me ung@@ r@@ ateful , but I don 't like having to justify myself to the entire public . "
West Vir@@ g@@ inia govern@@ or anno@@ unces he 's switching parties
The Democratic govern@@ or of West Vir@@ g@@ inia , J@@ im Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he 's switching parties .
" Like it or not like it , the Democrats wal@@ ked away from me , " Go@@ v. Justice said .
" Today I will tell you with lots of pra@@ yers and lots of thinking .@@ .. today I will tell you as West Vir@@ g@@ inians , I can 't help you anymore being a Democratic govern@@ or . "
The rally er@@ up@@ ted in che@@ ers .
" So tomorrow , I will be changing my registration to Republi@@ can , " Justice added .
" As a coach , I would tell you it 's time to run another play . "
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Vir@@ g@@ inia rally .
Mr. Trump won West Vir@@ g@@ inia by 42 points , and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nom@@ ine@@ e , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he own@@ s coal mines in five states , having inher@@ ited a coal business from his father .
He 's worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
Meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying " Govern@@ or Justice 's party switch is another b@@ low to a Democratic Party that would rather ob@@ struc@@ t than work to make our country great again . "
" With only 15 govern@@ or@@ ships and control of the fe@@ west state legis@@ lat@@ ures in history , Govern@@ or Justice 's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is lea@@ der@@ less from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , " RN@@ C chair@@ woman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in a statement to CB@@ S News .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises ' can@@ did ' Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ andal
Global ath@@ le@@ tics bo@@ ss Sebastian Co@@ e pra@@ ised what he described as a can@@ did ap@@ ology from Russia over a d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ andal on Thursday but reiter@@ ated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
Russia 's ath@@ le@@ tics bo@@ ss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin told an IA@@ AF Congress , held on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Champi@@ on@@ ships , that his country 's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ op@@ ing .
He said he was sorry to " all ath@@ let@@ es who have had gold and silver med@@ als s@@ nat@@ ched from them at competitions . "
Despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in fav@@ or of maintaining the ban , imposed in November 2015 after a World Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state @@@ -@@ @ sponsored d@@ op@@ ing in Russia .
" I thought it was a very can@@ did response today , a very can@@ did presentation , " IA@@ AF president Co@@ e told re@@ por@@ ters .
" The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased .@@ .. that the Russian feder@@ ation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty tor@@ rid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the feder@@ ation is re@@ engine@@ ered . "
Co@@ e said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to re@@ inst@@ ate Russia , " said Co@@ e .
" We need to do everything over the next few months to normali@@ ze this situation .
The gui@@ ding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ let@@ es from the tain@@ ted system , " he added
N@@ in@@ et@@ een Russian ath@@ let@@ es will be comp@@ eting as neut@@ r@@ als at the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Champi@@ on@@ ships which start in London on Friday , having met strict IA@@ AF criteria .
The head of the IA@@ AF 's Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ testing was still insufficient and banned co@@ aches were still operating freely , he told re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council .
Act of mo@@ ur@@ ning for soldiers who cra@@ shed in Mali
At a mem@@ orial service in the north H@@ essen town of F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people commem@@ or@@ ated both soldiers who lost their lives in a he@@ licopter cra@@ sh in Mali .
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precau@@ tions .
German Defence Minister Ur@@ sul@@ a von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) remained silent on the as @@@ -@@ @ yet @@@ -@@ @ un@@ explained cause of the cra@@ sh .
However , she described the two pil@@ ots who were killed as " experts in their field . "
" We bow before this greatest of sacri@@ fic@@ es that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .
The 33 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Major and the 47 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old St@@ ab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from north H@@ essen lost their lives a week ago , on Wednesday , in the West African country of Mali .
Their coff@@ ins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter 's cathedral in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , accompanied by a wake from the German army .
At mid@@ day , the rel@@ atives first said their goo@@ d@@ by@@ es in the church .
Then , ami@@ d@@ st family and closest friends , the mem@@ orial service was begun by representatives of the German Army and the political world .
Among these were H@@ esse Prime Minister Vol@@ ker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and In@@ spec@@ tor General of the German Army , Vol@@ ker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
Memorial guests laid down ro@@ ses , and the rel@@ atives stood arm in arm by the coff@@ ins .
The people of F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and numerous soldi@@ er followed the ceremony in front of the church on a big screen .
Defence minister von der Ley@@ en described the killed soldiers as " highly decorated " and experienced in missions .
The St@@ ab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat he@@ licopter Ti@@ ger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six qualified Ti@@ ger pil@@ ots in his regi@@ ment .
Vol@@ ker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s too , comm@@ ander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belon@@ ged , said : " If this crew were not able to prevent the cra@@ sh , then no @@@ -@@ @ one could have . "
Minister von der Ley@@ en did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali : the mission was dangerous .
However , it was also of great importance " for a country from which we are separated by only two nations , " she said .
After the mem@@ orial service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
The Germany Army did not wish to give any indications about when or where they are to be bur@@ ied .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be bur@@ ied next to his wife after his death .
The royal family shared that on Thursday .
Tra@@ ditionally , the Danish royal couple are inter@@ red in Ro@@ sk@@ il@@ de Cathedral .
The sculp@@ tor Bild@@ h@@ auer Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard is already cra@@ fting a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two of them .
The qu@@ een is content with her husband 's decision , the announcement continued .
Where Prince Hen@@ rik will be bur@@ ied is still un@@ clear .
However , he does not intend to be inter@@ red in his French hom@@ eland .
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
After his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the 's accession to the th@@ rone in 1972 , he would have liked to have become king .
In 2016 , he went into retirement and at the same time also laid aside his title of " Prince Con@@ sort . "
Since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function that he wanted in Denmark , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death either , explains L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , chief spo@@ kes@@ woman for the Danish royal family .
Where the last place of rest will be in the end for the 83 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old is still un@@ clear .
However , he does not intend to be inter@@ red in his French hom@@ eland , but rather in Denmark .
He li@@ kes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
Born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , the son of a noble French family , he had got to know Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 in London .
He worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
Wher@@ eas the people 's expres@@ sions of symp@@ athy always fle@@ w to his then to be wife , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had a hard time with the Dan@@ es during his almost 50 @@@ -@@ @ year reign .
In an auto@@ bio@@ graphy , Hen@@ rik commented on his first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything that I did was critic@@ ised .
My Danish was fal@@ tering , I preferred wine to beer , sil@@ k so@@ cks to w@@ ool so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n to Volvo , tennis to football .
Even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked in place of Vir@@ g@@ inia tobacco , and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellec@@ tu@@ als who were critical of society , I could not hope for any l@@ eni@@ ency .
I was different .
It seemed I was happy with this position and not ash@@ amed of it .
Those were two errors ! "
Prime Minister Weil wants a sn@@ ap new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP face possible majority in Lower Sax@@ ony
Lower Sax@@ ony 's prime minister Stephan Weil ( SP@@ D ) wants the State Parliament to have a sn@@ ap new election after the loss of the red @@@ -@@ @ green governing majority - but he doesn 't want to step down .
Weil declared himself on Friday to be in favour of a dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
Pre@@ viously , the un@@ expected re@@ sign@@ ation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fra@@ ction in Lower Sax@@ ony had pl@@ ung@@ ed Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SP@@ D ) ' s government into a stark crisis .
Five months before the official date of the state elections , the red @@@ -@@ @ green coalition lost in Hanover , and with that , their sc@@ ant one @@@ -@@ @ vote majority in Parliament over the opposition of CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ westen , up until that point a Green Party representative , justified her move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Ro@@ ten@@ burg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
" I see my political future in the CD@@ U , " she stated on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U parliamentary group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to advise his party to take her in .
Then the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP would together have 69 seats in the Lower Sax@@ ony State Parliament , and the Greens , 68 seats .
Up until now , that ratio was the other way around .
The new State Parliament will be elected as normal on the 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler says that the red @@@ -@@ @ green State Government now has to decide whether it can continue to go@@ vern in these circumstances without a majority .
However , Stephan Weil considers it imper@@ ative that the State Parliament vote to dis@@ solve itself as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible .
The CD@@ U parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how they will proceed .
The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament decla@@ res no confidence in the Prime Minister and elec@@ ts a successor .
" Our constitution offers various options .
The possibilities have to be examined in a proper legal way , " said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
" All aspects will be debated in good time , if they are examined in a sound legal way . "
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ westen 's move " somewhat curi@@ ous though . "
The politi@@ cian herself stressed : " I am not a tra@@ it@@ or .
I feel very good . "
She described herself as a suppor@@ ter of Black @@@ -@@ @ Green .
The Greens called on the def@@ ecting representative to give up her seat in Parliament .
" We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament , which she won on a Green party ticket , with immediate effect , " communic@@ ated state chair@@ persons Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @@@ -@@ @ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
The Green Party chair@@ woman An@@ ja P@@ iel said : " We exce@@ ed@@ ingly regret El@@ ke T@@ westen 's decision . "
She consci@@ ously decided not to give any statement in the parliamentary group .
" Especially given the background , that there were no essential differences - we can 't understand this move . "
SP@@ D candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz den@@ ounc@@ ed the crossing over of Lower Sax@@ ony Green representative El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
" The behaviour of the former Green representative in Lower Sax@@ ony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters , but also a betra@@ yal to red @@@ -@@ @ green , " wrote the Social Democratic federal leader on Friday on Facebook .
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SP@@ D ) ' s decision to let the State Parliament have new elections soon .
T@@ westen 's re@@ sign@@ ation costs Red @@@ -@@ @ Green the majority in Lower Sax@@ ony .
The politi@@ cian " in her wo@@ und@@ ed v@@ anity and in her fru@@ stration " put " her personal interests above the well@@ being of the state , " cri@@ ti@@ si@@ sed SP@@ D General Secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Hei@@ l .
" It is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Sax@@ ony plays along in this dir@@ ty sch@@ em@@ ing and attempts to score political points from it . "
Lower Sax@@ ony CD@@ U parliamentary group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to advise his representatives to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
The parliamentary group leader of the SP@@ D in the Bun@@ de@@ stag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ man , accused T@@ westen of distor@@ ting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career no@@ tions .
The CD@@ U was then the strongest power ahead of the SP@@ D , but SP@@ D and Greens had a w@@ af@@ er @@@ -@@ @ thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves against po@@ is@@ oned eggs , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing contam@@ inated eggs .
How was it possible for the sc@@ andal to happen ?
How can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) answers our questions in interview with Red@@ aktions@@ Netzwerk Deutschland ( RN@@ D ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the st@@ amps printed on them .
The federal states are each sup@@ plying their most up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information on the affected egg bat@@ ches on the consumer protection portal w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .@@ de@@ .
Aff@@ ected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
Even if , according to everything we know at this point in time , a health risk is all but ruled out .
Is Al@@ di now adopting the best possible reaction to the crisis - removing all eggs from their offering - because the Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture is not really playing the central role of providing clear information ?
Monitoring food@@ stuffs is a task for the federal states .
Despite that , the mini@@ stry immediately connected and has been li@@ a@@ ising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected .
All information and the risk assessment are accessible to consumers .
It is up to the trade just as much as it is the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold meet trading requirements and do not present any health risks .
For eggs , if the maximum resi@@ due level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , then they do not meet trading requirements .
Un@@ contam@@ inated eggs , however , can be sold and consum@@ ed .
This time the businesses are not at fault .
Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
According to what we currently know , the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame .
In fact , due to susp@@ ected illegal practices by service companies , they have to deal with commercial claims .
As always in emer@@ gen@@ cies , there are too few inspec@@ tors .
Is it just the number of staff that is lacking , or the key competence as well ?
It was actually the official controls themselves that exposed what was going on .
However , we must also remember that food fraud and criminal activity can never be 100 % elimin@@ ated .
It is for precisely this reason that it is so cru@@ cially important to have such occur@@ ren@@ ces thoroughly cle@@ ared up and passed over to public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes could have committed .
I have already made it clear many times that I am exp@@ ecting a complete resolution from the authorities in charge .
Is the alar@@ mis@@ m that regularly arises with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
Con@@ sum@@ ers have the right to get only safe food that is approved for market .
If a prohibited in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are quite right to be indi@@ gn@@ ant .
Thanks to these adul@@ ter@@ ated products , manufacturers , retail@@ ers and consumers get into a situation that is entirely unnecessary .
Fundam@@ ent@@ ally the following has to be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the farming of food @@@ -@@ @ producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately .
Work must be done on this consistently and urgently at all levels .
I expect all responsible authorities to clear up the matter swi@@ ft@@ ly and completely .
How so@@ ccer 's financial rules impact Ne@@ y@@ mar 's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing un@@ f@@ et@@ tered spending by European so@@ ccer clubs will not dis@@ rupt Ne@@ y@@ mar 's world @@@ -@@ @ record transfer from Spain 's Barcelona to France 's Paris @@@ -@@ @ Saint Ger@@ main .
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint @@@ -@@ @ Ger@@ main from U@@ EF@@ A , the governing body over@@ seeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champi@@ ons League tournament .
Financial Fair Play rules launched by U@@ EF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G will eventually have to show that Ne@@ y@@ mar 's transfer was funded without inc@@ ur@@ ring huge losses .
Barcelona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Ne@@ y@@ mar will command a sal@@ ary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar 's move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly st@@ um@@ p up the cash to sign Ne@@ y@@ mar and add him to a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the team 's funding from the energy @@@ -@@ @ rich ruling family of Q@@ atar .
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acqu@@ iring players but they have to counter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach break @@@ -@@ @ even on their football @@@ -@@ @ related business .
FF@@ P was concei@@ ved by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as U@@ EF@@ A president in 2007 .
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge deb@@ ts in their pursu@@ it of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king ru@@ in if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
In 2011 , FF@@ P shi@@ fted from focusing on clubs ' deb@@ ts to monitoring their losses instead .
The change meant that the business model Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch initially used at Chel@@ sea in 2003 - buy a club with potential , and then spend heavily to improve the squ@@ ad and build a global brand - become a tou@@ gh@@ er pro@@ position .
During the current three @@@ -@@ @ year FF@@ P assessment period that runs through 2018 , clubs can inc@@ ur losses of 30 million euros .
And despite Plat@@ ini being ou@@ sted in dis@@ grace from the presidency in 2015 , his U@@ EF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in is still committed to deter@@ ring excessive spending .
" Cer@@ tain@@ ly FF@@ P is not dead and we will , for sure , reinforce the rules going forward , " Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ sees FF@@ P at U@@ EF@@ A , told The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
Although PS@@ G will have paid Ne@@ y@@ mar 's bu@@ y@@ out clause in one l@@ um@@ p sum , it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five @@@ -@@ @ year deal , so the transfer fee could be shown as a 4@@ 4.4 million @@@ -@@ @ euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years .
The first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 saw PS@@ G , along with Abu Dhabi @@@ -@@ @ owned Manchester City , hit with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G was handed a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champi@@ ons League squ@@ ads to 21 players for the 2014 @@@ -@@ @ 15 season instead of the normal 25 .
U@@ EF@@ A is on the loo@@ k@@ out for clubs who might try to out@@ wi@@ t its financial regulators by inf@@ lating their income through companies linked to a club 's owners .
While a Q@@ at@@ ari company could spons@@ or PS@@ G , if the value of the spon@@ sor@@ ship was deemed to exceed standard market rates U@@ EF@@ A would not allow it to count as legitimate income .
That is what happened in 2014 when U@@ EF@@ A ruled that the value of the Q@@ atar Tourism Authority spon@@ sor@@ ship of PS@@ G was infl@@ ated .
It has been reported that part of Ne@@ y@@ mar 's PS@@ G earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organi@@ zing committee in Q@@ atar .
But PS@@ G and Q@@ atar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ y@@ mar will become a World Cup am@@ bassador and such a man@@ eu@@ ver would be easy for U@@ EF@@ A 's regulators to ex@@ pose .
P@@ ast sanctions sla@@ pped on PS@@ G means that U@@ EF@@ A will be even more wat@@ ch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
U@@ EF@@ A has not been in p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ emp@@ tive discussions with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar 's transfer , people familiar with the situation said Thursday .
They spoke to The Associ@@ ated Press on condition of an@@ onym@@ ity as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
The last published accounts show that PS@@ G made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 @@@ -@@ @ 16 on a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
Ac@@ counts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar 's arrival to be a bo@@ on for spon@@ sor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing .
Cle@@ arly ir@@ rit@@ ated to see one of so@@ ccer 's biggest players leaving , the Spanish le@@ ague tried to sty@@ mie Ne@@ y@@ mar 's move , claim@@ ing that PS@@ G will be bre@@ aching FF@@ P .
" It is a clear case of ' financial d@@ op@@ ing ' , with the club and the state , " La Li@@ ga President Javier T@@ eb@@ as told Spanish newspaper AS , referring to Q@@ atar 's ultimate ownership of PS@@ G .
Ar@@ sen@@ al manager Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares La Li@@ ga 's reservations about a state funding a club .
" It is the consequence of the own@@ er@@ ships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " W@@ enger said Thursday .
" Once a country own@@ s a club , everything is possible .
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country . "

In the last few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made on @@@ -@@ @ board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss .
Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end : the airline is inviting new calls for ten@@ ders .
Swiss spo@@ kes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ro@@ tt , in response to a query from news agency s@@ da , confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper " Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z " on Friday .
According to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year of 2018 .
The products would be reviewed and under@@ go a quality control every two to three years .
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , " said the spo@@ kes@@ woman .
Every year , around 17 million small 14 @@@ -@@ @ gram chocolate bars pack@@ aged in red and white are handed out by the flight att@@ end@@ ants to passengers before landing .
Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs .
According to " Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z , " industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volumes to be 1.5 to 2 million fran@@ cs - the Mi@@ gro@@ s subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion fran@@ cs .
However , more important is always the advertising effect : for a chocolate producer , it is a prestigious contract .
Swiss will not disc@@ lose how many bi@@ d@@ ders there are for the new call for ten@@ ders .
However , only Swiss producers are eligible .
According to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive to ren@@ ew the contract beyond Spring 2018 .
The biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available to the s@@ da for a statement .
Swiss has been hand@@ ing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mi@@ gro@@ s subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate bars , in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss introduced the possibility of inser@@ ting a logo two and a half years ago , at the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
The airline collabor@@ ates with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
On long @@@ -@@ @ hau@@ l flights , the first class customers are spo@@ iled with tre@@ ats from conf@@ ection@@ er Sp@@ r@@ ün@@ gli ; in business class , passengers ni@@ b@@ ble on chocolate from Lin@@ dt , and in economy class , chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
On short @@@ -@@ @ hau@@ l routes too , Swiss hands out chocolate from Cho@@ colate Fre@@ y , both in business and in economy class .

No@@ stal@@ gia Go@@ es Ni@@ che in " W@@ et Hot American Summer " and " Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective "
So this it@@ er@@ ation of the story is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic for the characters ' ' 80@@ s glory days ; for the ' 90@@ s gr@@ unge era ( around when the master@@ minds David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter made the sk@@ etch com@@ edy " The State " for M@@ TV ) ; and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Am@@ y Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ d@@ d , went on to bigger things .
As a cultural arti@@ fact , it 's both a sen@@ du@@ p and embo@@ di@@ ment of our Facebook @@@ -@@ @ enabled era of permanent remin@@ is@@ c@@ ence .
But as a fran@@ ch@@ ise , it feels like it 's running out of time .
" First Day of Camp " worked surpris@@ ingly well , not just because of its absur@@ di@@ st hum@@ or ( it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables , vo@@ ic@@ ed by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
By dou@@ bling down on the core ga@@ g - middle @@@ -@@ @ age actors playing hor@@ ny kids coming of age - it made the im@@ possibility of rec@@ ap@@ turing the past part of the jo@@ ke .
" T@@ en Years L@@ ater , " with its adults now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally roo@@ ted and its par@@ ody more sc@@ atter@@ shot , including a riff on ' 90@@ s stal@@ ker fli@@ cks like " The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . "
At one point a character ru@@ mm@@ ages through an Apple Power@@ book , some in @@@ -@@ @ line sk@@ ates and " a b@@ unch of other things from 1991 . "
Many of the core stories are the same .
Swe@@ et @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted Coo@@ p ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now a nov@@ eli@@ st , still has@@ n 't gotten over K@@ ati@@ e ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still has@@ n 't lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
And there 's another bat@@ ti@@ ly vil@@ la@@ in@@ ous plot involving Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now ab@@ et@@ ted by George H. W. Bush ( a well @@@ -@@ @ inhabited impression by Michael I@@ an Black ) .
As always , the best part of the fran@@ ch@@ ise is the dig@@ res@@ sions .
It 's especially fun to see the fore@@ ver @@@ -@@ @ young Mr. Ru@@ d@@ d , sporting Mat@@ t D@@ illon 's soul patch from " Sing@@ les , " whose former big @@@ -@@ @ man @@@ -@@ @ on @@@ -@@ @ camp Andy now feels like a ge@@ e@@ zer .
It 's the moments of random l@@ un@@ acy that might power this fran@@ ch@@ ise on , like a kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive " S@@ even Up ! " series , until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion : " W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , " whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of " W@@ et Hot American Summer . "
" Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective " on Amazon , mean@@ while , appe@@ als to a different brand of no@@ stal@@ gia : the Cold War revi@@ v@@ alism of " The Americans , " the film " Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de " and even " GLO@@ W , " with its East ver@@ sus West w@@ rest@@ ling i@@ con@@ o@@ graphy .
The com@@ edy , created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas direc@@ ting , pur@@ ports to be found TV : a Romanian 1980s bud@@ dy @@@ -@@ @ co@@ p dra@@ ma about two Buch@@ arest officers fighting for truth , ath@@ ei@@ sm and the Mar@@ x@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ Len@@ in@@ ist way .
The lead roles - hard @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ iled Greg@@ or and ide@@ alistic Io@@ se@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corne@@ li@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , their dialogue du@@ b@@ bed in English by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gord@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Lev@@ itt .
It 's a brilliant idea .
But it 's not much more than an idea .
There are some fine sight g@@ ags ( the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football ) .
And the ro@@ ster of famous voice @@@ -@@ @ over actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , N@@ ick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a decent game of spot @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ voice .
But " Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective " is so committed to the veri@@ si@@ mi@@ li@@ tude of a ham@@ fi@@ sted propag@@ anda dra@@ ma - a k@@ iller we@@ aring a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like one .
At six long ep@@ iso@@ des , it dra@@ gs , and the com@@ edy isn 't fast or frequent enough .
Edi@@ ted to a ti@@ ghter length , " Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective " might deliver better on its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re , as when Greg@@ or and Io@@ se@@ f repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wol@@ fing down a pi@@ le of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
The message , for the imag@@ ined communist audience , is that Western culture can turn anything into fo@@ d@@ der to bin@@ ge .
The fic@@ tional Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : We even do it with our own recent history , and thei@@ rs .
B@@ low dealt to drug ma@@ fia in the country
The police have delivered a successful b@@ low against the Italian M@@ af@@ ia in Baden Württemberg .
On Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @@@ -@@ @ Ba@@ ar district , numerous properties were sear@@ ched in Ro@@ tt@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , said the Kon@@ stanz public prosec@@ utor 's office on Friday .
In the course of this , 15 accused , aged between 25 and 77 , were detain@@ ed and already had arrest warran@@ ts issued against them .
In addition , officials sei@@ zed large quantities of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
At simultane@@ ous ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were detain@@ ed .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ected Itali@@ ans .
Both of them were therefore pre@@ sum@@ ably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the operation .
In total , over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
The ma@@ fia members were charged with organised drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime , serious acts of violence , attemp@@ ted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
Kon@@ stanz public prosec@@ utor 's office has been investig@@ ating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already .
There was an active exchange between the public prosec@@ utor 's offices in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , and the investig@@ ators from Ro@@ tt@@ weil C@@ ID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
The major operation on Wednesday morning was thus attended by four officials from Palermo .
The investigations then turned their sights above all to Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian ma@@ fia .
An incident on 27@@ th May in Hü@@ fin@@ gen , during which several shots were fi@@ red into a restaurant in the early morning , is also likely to have been caused by the gang .
Weise compla@@ ins of big holes in the Register of Foreign Nation@@ als
" Data for citizens that ought not to be showing up there " : according to a report , the Register of Fo@@ reign@@ er Nation@@ als in Germany is exhibit@@ ing significant defects .
This is leading to some grave mistakes in decisions within asylum procedures .
Frank @@@ -@@ @ Jürgen Weise , the official appoin@@ tee of the German Government for the management of refugees , has brought attention to big holes in the Central Register of Foreign Nation@@ als , according to one media report .
Def@@ ects in the data registered there could lead to " some grave mistakes in decisions " when it comes to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , war@@ ned Weise in an analysis received by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
According to that information , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , among whom around 5.@@ 7 million from non @@@ -@@ @ EU states .
The data are managed by around 600 Fo@@ reign@@ ers ' Regi@@ stration Off@@ ices in Germany .
Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , it said , the quality of the data has in part not been good to date .
In some cases , data from 19@@ 21 was found , " from people who have long been dead , or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register . "
" Er@@ ron@@ eous data entries can significantly slow down return processes , " the report continues .
Moreover , within the statistics on those people who are obliged to leave the country are recorded EU citizens , who do not at all have to leave .
Such false categ@@ or@@ is@@ ations , however , led to " a bi@@ ased debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave the country , " it says accordingly in the analysis .
Meanwhile , the German Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 years of age , if this is where they entered the country from .
This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the " Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . "
In the paper , it says that the B@@ AM@@ F has been once more trans@@ acting such procedures " that concern families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and very small children - to Italy since 1st June 2017 . "
Since the end of 2014 , that had practically no longer been possible , says the newspaper , poin@@ ting to the difficult situation on the ground .
According to the Dublin Regulation , it is the EU state the refugee first reaches that is responsible for them .
If a migrant tra@@ vels further into another EU country , this state can send him back to the country he entered from .
As a means of justification , the office writes : " By now , the in@@ take capacity for families with children who are min@@ ors has significantly increased in Italy . "
Italy has provided guarantees for the in@@ take and accommodation of families .
The European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) itself considers these ple@@ dges to be sufficient .
Other EU states too would send back refugees there using the scope of the Dublin Agreement .
The Lin@@ ke party 's spo@@ kes@@ woman for domestic po@@ ic@@ y , U@@ lla El@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : " Due to shortcomings in the Italian asylum system , families with children are threatened with conditions of admission that contra@@ ven@@ e human rights and with risk to the child 's welfare "
Second @@@ -@@ @ best result achieved
Al@@ together , the blood donor service made 220 lit@@ res of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach available for others .
At least , from the twelve citizens who were hon@@ oured on Friday .
A@@ head of everyone is Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has by now shared 50 lit@@ res of blood with his 100 don@@ ations .
The community traditionally acknowled@@ ges the repeated willingness to give blood in the meeting of its municipal council .
" It is in@@ geni@@ ous how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for stran@@ gers , and so sel@@ fl@@ ess@@ ly , " stressed may@@ or Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Ki@@ st@@ ner .
" One single blood don@@ ation helps multiple people , " explained the district head of the on @@@ -@@ @ call service of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Hol@@ ger Ma@@ isen@@ b@@ acher , for the reserves are broken down into their components .
So , as many as three people could benefit from a single blood don@@ ation .
At the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ b@@ acher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
" This year , we achieved our second best result ever , with 114 donors , " said the DR@@ K on @@@ -@@ @ call district head .
Ob@@ viously the move into the theatre venue a few years ago led to a higher number of participants .
Already before then , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Sus@@ anne Reich@@ le , Sand@@ ra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were num@@ ber@@ ed amongst the repeat donors and hon@@ oured for having made 50 don@@ ations each .
Hal@@ f as many were clo@@ cked up by Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ the@@ e Rei@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Pet@@ ra Schle@@ eh , Ste@@ fan@@ ie St@@ oll and U@@ we V@@ etter each gave 500 milli@@ lit@@ res of their li@@ f@@ eb@@ lood .
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain un@@ changed after lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e economic growth and e@@ asing inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a hi@@ ke .
The Bank of England has war@@ ned economic growth will remain " s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish " as it kept interest rates on hold am@@ id a tigh@@ tening squ@@ ee@@ ze on family in@@ comes .
Po@@ lic@@ y@@ makers on the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 @@@ -@@ @ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e economic growth has weak@@ ened support for a hi@@ ke .
In its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and cau@@ tioned the squ@@ ee@@ ze on household in@@ comes would continue , with inflation still expected to sur@@ ge close to 3 % in the autumn .
But it sign@@ alled rate hi@@ kes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Bre@@ x@@ it @@@ -@@ @ fu@@ elled inflation and said bor@@ rowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
Members also voted to withdraw part of the m@@ am@@ mo@@ th economy @@@ -@@ @ boo@@ sting package un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed a year ago in the after@@ mat@@ h of Bre@@ x@@ it .
It will call time on the Ter@@ m Fund@@ ing Sch@@ eme to offer cheap @@@ -@@ @ finance to banks from next February , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 115 billion .
In minutes of the rates decision , the Bank said : " In the M@@ PC 's central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish in the near @@@ -@@ @ term as the squ@@ ee@@ ze on households ' real in@@ comes continues to wei@@ gh on consumption . "
On rates , it reiter@@ ated that " some tigh@@ tening of monetary policy " would be needed to cool inflation and by a " somewhat greater " extent than markets expect .
Markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
But the Bank stressed that any hi@@ kes would be " gradual " and " limited . "
The Bank 's down@@ gra@@ ded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.@@ 9 % and 1.7 % predic@@ ted in May .
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .
Ster@@ ling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news .
The po@@ und was 0.5 % down at 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
The no @@@ -@@ @ change decision comes after recent dis@@ appoin@@ ting growth figures have damp@@ ened mounting expectations of a hi@@ ke , with GDP ed@@ ging up to 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months .
Growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year , according to the Bank .
Its latest inflation report offered little che@@ er for households being hit by so@@ aring inflation and pal@@ try pay rises as it said the squ@@ ee@@ ze will get worse before it gets better .
It added that monetary policy " cannot prevent " the hit to in@@ comes over the next few years , but expects wages will recover " significantly " towards the end of its three @@@ -@@ @ year forecast .
The economy is also set for a boost from sur@@ ging demand for British goods thanks to the weak po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumer spending .
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock EU referendum vote , which sent the po@@ und sl@@ um@@ ping .
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
Pri@@ or to the Bank 's latest rates ver@@ dict , there had been growing cl@@ am@@ our for a rate rise as inflation ra@@ mp@@ ed up pressure on hard @@@ -@@ @ pressed households , with three policy@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
Inflation e@@ ased back to 2.6 % last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months .
The Bank said the over@@ sho@@ ot relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " down to the weak po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : " Given the recent fall in s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as len@@ ders cl@@ am@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fashion .
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re @@@ -@@ @ mort@@ g@@ ages , many with fee @@@ -@@ @ free options as well as low rates , become ever more popular . "
N@@ HS to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10@@ ,000
Pati@@ ents will be able to access a ' transform@@ ative ' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , a pil@@ l taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high @@@ -@@ @ risk individuals by around 86 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial three @@@ -@@ @ year trial to an estimated 10@@ ,000 people .
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of App@@ eal uph@@ eld a High Court ruling last year , which said the N@@ HS had the power to pay for Pr@@ EP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it .
The move announced on Thursday was ha@@ iled as a ' major new intervention ' by N@@ HS England chief executive Simon Ste@@ vens while the National Ai@@ ds Trust ( N@@ AT ) described it as a ' pi@@ vo@@ tal moment ' .
Sex@@ ual health clin@@ ics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sh@@ eff@@ ield will be among the first to start en@@ rolling people , with more clin@@ ics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018 .
P@@ re @@@ -@@ @ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV .
Tri@@ als have shown Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at @@@ -@@ @ risk of infection .
Tak@@ ing Pr@@ EP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person 's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold .
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex .
Those eligible for the treatment include ga@@ y or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and those with HIV @@@ -@@ @ positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment .
Clin@@ ics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti @@@ -@@ @ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to en@@ rol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health cl@@ inic .
The programme will cost £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
Mr Ste@@ vens said : ' This major new intervention should complement and super@@ charge the wide @@@ -@@ @ ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV .
It 's another milestone in more than three decades ' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity 's major health challenges . ' 
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , chief executive at N@@ AT ( National Ai@@ ds Trust ) , said : ' This is a pi@@ vo@@ tal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted properly at those in need and at risk , offers the possibility of trans@@ forming the English HIV epide@@ mic .
From September , people at high risk of HIV will have access via this N@@ HS @@@ -@@ @ funded trial in England to an em@@ power@@ ing new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . ' 
I@@ an Green , chief executive of the Ter@@ rence Hi@@ gg@@ ins Trust , said : ' The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out spe@@ edi@@ ly across the country , and that no @@@ -@@ @ one at risk of HIV is left behind .
Now that the Pr@@ EP trial drug has been proc@@ ured , we 're well on the way to protecting over 10@@ ,000 people at risk of HIV . ' 
Sh@@ adow public health minister Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son said : ' The start of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and long over@@ due after months of delays and he@@ el @@@ -@@ @ dra@@ gging by the Government .
The evidence shows just how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @@@ -@@ @ changing infection .
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . ' 
Living the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and cle@@ ver design tri@@ cks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for doing up property , down@@ sized from a large home in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has@@ n 't packed her bags and sold on .
" Before this , I was living with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , " Jo@@ anne says .
" I was looking for something that was comparable for my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day . "
Since the first viewing , the 1,@@ 000@@ s@@ q ft flat has had a complete over@@ hau@@ l .
Origin@@ ally a one @@@ -@@ @ bedroom property with a con@@ vol@@ uted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the generous ceiling height .
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .
That was my requirement , " she says .
To this end , she employed Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill @@@ -@@ @ based architecture and design studio Du@@ ck & Sh@@ ed to exploit the 12.@@ 5@@ ft ceilings and create a home that wasn 't only a development but a place for Jo@@ anne to live .
The ceiling wasn 't quite t@@ all enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the brief .
" The ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , " he explains .
" We had to arrange the spaces so that they st@@ acked on top of each other without need@@ ing to h@@ unch down .
It wasn 't just building a simple platform , but cran@@ king the ste@@ els so that they were at the right height for the function above or below . "
This arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to get two full @@@ -@@ @ height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added dra@@ ma .
For the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a v@@ intage copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area below .
Mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and v@@ intage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting all set the style for the scheme .
The use of mir@@ rors plays a part in adding theatre , space and light .
A short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
In the kitchen , the mir@@ ro@@ red sp@@ lash@@ back feels like a window to another room .
At the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units provide storage for all Jo@@ anne 's cut@@ ler@@ y and gl@@ ass@@ ware .
Gi@@ ving the perception of a more gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it 's not in use .
Fol@@ da@@ way kit@@ chens are nothing new .
What 's unique about this one is that it 's a garage @@@ -@@ @ style lift @@@ -@@ @ up door .
" A bit of engineering went into that , " explains Er@@ fan of the steel @@@ -@@ @ reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered M@@ DF door .
" It 's counter @@@ -@@ @ wei@@ ghted so that when you push the door up , it gli@@ des really easily . "
Thanks to cle@@ ver use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne gained an additional 16@@ s@@ q m , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
" At the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valu@@ ed , " Er@@ fan says .
" In a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size . "
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge .
" The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Er@@ fan .
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical fe@@ eds in the walls .
These are important but they don 't pull the heart str@@ ings . "
It goes to show that through good design and increased square met@@ re@@ age , a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing .
In fact , like Jo@@ anne , you may choose not to leave .
Bro@@ thers fight over $ 500 million property emp@@ ire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria 's biggest real estate emp@@ ires , worth more than $ 500 million , four decades after their Italian family founded the d@@ yn@@ asty .
Former Carl@@ ton Football Club director and developer Co@@ lin De Lu@@ tis lives in a To@@ or@@ ak man@@ sion three doors from younger brother Paul , who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be s@@ lic@@ ed up .
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an ac@@ ri@@ mon@@ i@@ ous argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break @@@ -@@ @ up .
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , am@@ ass@@ ed since the family bought a Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , shop in 1973 .
There , the family founded West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail out@@ lets .
It sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
That money was sun@@ k into property and the De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes city offices , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to development sites , Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler apartments , and sub@@ urban shopping centres .
Under an agreement with their late father , Co@@ lin - described by Paul as " the major driving force and the dominant personality " in the De Lu@@ tis family - own@@ s about two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the company assets and Paul about one @@@ -@@ @ third .
A court fil@@ ing says this transl@@ ates to Co@@ lin own@@ ing property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul $ 176 million .
Divi@@ ding the properties and cash has proved the sti@@ cking point for Paul .
" The sp@@ li@@ ts proposed by Co@@ lin left him with what I considered to be the best properties , " he wrote in an initial court aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
Last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first Supreme Court hearing was held .
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleg@@ es Co@@ lin has lo@@ cked him out of .
Co@@ lin ar@@ gues this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently managing some properties .
In an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Co@@ lin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .
" My Italian heritage dict@@ ates that family is the most important priority , " he wrote .
Co@@ sts are mounting in the case , with hundreds of pages of aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , em@@ ails and reports by companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer filed and top bar@@ rist@@ ers including All@@ an M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and senior so@@ lic@@ it@@ ors re@@ tained by both sides .
Ms De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Lui@@ gi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950@@ s and in the early 197@@ 0s bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
They used the coll@@ ater@@ al to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Co@@ lin opened the family 's first je@@ ans store .
Co@@ lin says he started West@@ co there when he was " in my final years of high school , when Paul was a young child ( around 10 years old ) . "
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Lui@@ gi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass down their properties to their sons am@@ ic@@ ably .
" Lui@@ gi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court , " she wrote .
Two other brothers , Mark and Lu@@ ke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Co@@ lin saying that Mark was paid $ 10 million when he left the business , and Lu@@ ke $ 26 million .
Both Lu@@ ke and Mark had become , Paul says , " bit@@ ter about the terms of their financial separation . "
Co@@ lin has kept a low profile despite being a former AF@@ L club board member and , according to a 2015 bio@@ graphy of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the television star 's best friend .
Fair@@ fax Media cont@@ acted Co@@ lin and Paul De Lu@@ tis on Friday , and their lawyers .
Only Co@@ lin rep@@ lied , by text message , to say that because the case was before the courts " I really cannot say much . "
" It 's very , very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and dra@@ g our family name through the courts , " he wrote .
In mid @@@ -@@ @ 2016 , Co@@ lin wrote in one court fil@@ ing that he had tried to accommodate his brother 's requests .
" Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he was " still hop@@ e@@ ful of resolution . "
On Friday , that hope appeared gone .
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Co@@ lin wrote .
Trump 's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president 's media diet .
O@@ thers have tried and failed .
May@@ be John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
If so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the bo@@ ss on a more even ke@@ el .
Here 's a bit from re@@ porter Jo@@ sh Da@@ w@@ sey :
" When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kel@@ ly hu@@ dd@@ led with senior staff on his first day at work , he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump 's White House that he planned to fix : bad information getting into the president 's hands .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information . "
Kel@@ ly 's diagnosis makes perfect sense , but others have tried and failed to t@@ ame Trump by monitoring his media diet .
President Trump 's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he 's in the White House , his TV @@@ -@@ @ watching hab@@ it is still going strong .
" If candidate Trump was up@@ set about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from out@@ lets that were persu@@ ad@@ able , " S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaign adv@@ iser , told Poli@@ tico in February .
Poli@@ tico 's T@@ ara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady stream of pra@@ ise . "
Ok@@ ay .
But the idea that Trump 's Twitter hab@@ it has ever been " under control " is lau@@ gh@@ able .
May@@ be these campaign officials know something the rest of us don 't - that Trump 's t@@ we@@ ets would have been even more infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory if not for their interventions .
We 'll probably never know about t@@ we@@ ets that Trump didn 't send .
If his sta@@ ff@@ ers managed to him out of trouble even a few times , then their efforts were wor@@ th@@ while .
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stir@@ ring up contro@@ vers@@ y .
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of comp@@ eting fac@@ tions , people inv@@ ari@@ ably try to advance their agen@@ das by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their wor@@ ld@@ views .
Poli@@ tico - all over this story - reported in May on advis@@ ers ' pen@@ chan@@ ts for strategi@@ cally feeding du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president .
This was one example , described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
" Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcan@@ ically to negative press cli@@ ps , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , becoming en@@ gross@@ ed in finding out where they origin@@ ated .
That is what happened in late February when someone mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , which accused dep@@ uty chief of staff K@@ ati@@ e Wal@@ sh of being ' the source behind a b@@ unch of le@@ aks ' in the White House .
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lob@@ bed false acc@@ us@@ ations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . "
Gold@@ macher added that then @@@ -@@ @ chief of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and White House staff secre@@ tary Ro@@ b Por@@ ter " have tried to implement a system to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work Trump receives . "
How 'd that work out ?
Kel@@ ly is trying to do the same thing , three months later .
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Trump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his ai@@ des are still v@@ ying for influence .
Those imm@@ utable factors will make Kel@@ ly 's mission very difficult .
Most @@@ -@@ @ wanted criminals receive post from Europol
As the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is being requested and hoped for .
Police across all of Europe are sending ( virtual ) post@@ cards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run .
Since the addresses of the sought @@@ -@@ @ after serious criminals are not known , they are hop@@ ing and asking for tips from the population .
Europol reported on Friday about the campaign , which follows on from the " EU Most Wan@@ ted " adv@@ ent calendar from the winter .
Experience has shown that many fu@@ gi@@ tives hide out in holiday destinations , was the word from Europol .
21 post@@ cards for sought @@@ -@@ @ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been assem@@ bled .
The website w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ wanted has existed since 2016 , and has been visited more than 2.5 million times .
It has so far been possible to arrest 36 of those being sought online ; at least 11 of these are due to tips following publication on the internet site .
Tra@@ v@@ ellers negotiate tr@@ en@@ ch , return to ' Milli@@ on@@ aire 's ro@@ w@@ '
Some of the West Mid@@ lands ' we@@ al@@ thi@@ est hom@@ e@@ owners are again at log@@ ger@@ heads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council @@@ -@@ @ du@@ g tr@@ en@@ ch to rec@@ la@@ im a field outside their man@@ sions .
The travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a prosp@@ erous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull du@@ b@@ bed ' milli@@ on@@ aire 's row ' .
Br@@ ing@@ ing horses , bab@@ ies and an army of v@@ ans , they have returned after being ki@@ cked out only in May , und@@ eter@@ red by a mo@@ at du@@ g by the council to prevent their inc@@ ur@@ sions .
The tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the def@@ ences , squ@@ ee@@ zing their vehicles though a section left un@@ barri@@ c@@ aded to accommodate a path@@ way .
F@@ uri@@ ous residents have sav@@ aged Soli@@ h@@ ull Council saying it was ' us@@ eless at dealing with the problem ' .
One an@@ onymous resident said : ' They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from B@@ ent@@ ley He@@ ath where they were thro@@ wing rocks at p@@ asser@@ s by .
The council needs to be sh@@ amed into action as they are us@@ eless at dealing with the problem .
The travellers were there in May , were moved on and now they are back again .
More arrived last night , probably even more today . ' 
She added : ' Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long in@@ junc@@ tions to protect their parks .
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ ok road and I 'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can 't even stop this . ' 
One local resident who did not wish to be named said : ' It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving , only to be bli@@ ghted by another round .
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen gra@@ zing on the park@@ land . ' 
A spo@@ kes@@ woman for Soli@@ h@@ ull Council said : ' We are aware of an un@@ authorised en@@ camp@@ ment on land off Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ ok Road and working alongside Soli@@ h@@ ull Police , we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible .
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti @@@ -@@ @ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them . ' 
Bir@@ ken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
The former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof is being turned into the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
The house just outside Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and should be opened again on 1st March next year .
That is good news for the city .
For when the Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014 , at the time around 30@@ ,000 overnight stays per year were lost , and with that , the income from the visitors ' taxes .
In the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district , the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing , which spark@@ ed controversial discussions .
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location .
The decision passed in the municipal council back then without contro@@ vers@@ y .
Yet Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt 's l@@ ord may@@ or , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , in particular , def@@ ended the hotel location and already back then spoke of serious interested parties in the establishment .
And he was right .
The Lu@@ isen@@ hotels Group , with Managing Director Bir@@ g@@ it Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof at a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three @@@ -@@ @ stars @@@ -@@ @ or @@@ -@@ @ more category , under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
The group has four establish@@ ments including the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt property .
Two of them are in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , and one is in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
They are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and , now , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
There has been a ski@@ p standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof for a long time now , and when you enter the building , it becomes clear just how extensive the refur@@ bish@@ ment works are that are being undertaken .
The floors have been ri@@ pped out , ceilings partly disman@@ t@@ led , old bath tu@@ bs taken out of the rooms .
The entire hotel building is one big construction site .
There is still a lot to do before March .
" It is truly a beautiful hotel , " says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our paper .
Everything is to be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
The rooms are being kit@@ ted out with large , walk @@@ -@@ @ in sho@@ wers , the entrance fo@@ yer is being rev@@ amp@@ ed , new windows are being installed .
Everything should later become " beauti@@ fully in touch with the people , " is how Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed it .
" We want to make a gem of it . "
S@@ wimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
One doesn 't want to position on@@ es@@ elf at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but still at an elev@@ ated downtown level , stressed Sch@@ erer .
The Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its roughly 60 rooms , wants to set itself up for a broad audience , explains Sch@@ erer further .
Individual holiday @@@ -@@ @ makers , groups , and business people , should all feel at home in the hotel .
Sch@@ erer said that he had already had convers@@ ations with Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Director of Tourism Michael K@@ rau@@ se .
The city 's expectations are said to be in line with those of the hotel group .
" We 're on the same page . "
A@@ sk@@ ed about the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn 't want to commit himself precisely .
A little under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
The outside facilities are also being rev@@ amp@@ ed - that can already be seen .
In an inner courtyard , a large terrace is taking shape , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : " Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . "
Russia aff@@ air : US Special Coun@@ sel conven@@ es grand jury
In the Russia aff@@ air surrounding US President Donald Trump , Special Coun@@ sel Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have conven@@ ed a so @@@ -@@ @ called grand jury , according to one report .
The panel started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal , " rel@@ ying on sources in@@ timately acqu@@ ain@@ ted with the matter .
The newspaper jud@@ ged the step to be a sign that Mu@@ eller has broad@@ ened and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
The broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that the panel has already issued its first sub@@ po@@ en@@ as in connection with a meeting between Trump 's oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
US secret service has long been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin of pur@@ po@@ se@@ fully inter@@ fer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller is investig@@ ating whether there was any col@@ lu@@ sion between Trump 's campaign team and Moscow .
Several men who acted as Republi@@ can advis@@ ers during the election campaign are said to stand at the centre of the investigations .
According to reports , Mu@@ eller has been subjec@@ ting Trump 's private and business cir@@ cles to more and more scrutiny .
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Coun@@ sel has personally shi@@ fted the centre of focus onto Trump and is investig@@ ating the charge of whether or not the President could have ob@@ struc@@ ted the course of justice during the aff@@ air .
It is the main task of the grand jury to review the available evidence in cases of possible fel@@ oni@@ es and to decide whether charges should be brought .
Grand j@@ uries are for this reason also called prosec@@ ution cham@@ bers .
They are usually engaged for major and controversial cases .
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
The panel may also be engaged by the public prosec@@ utor 's office to sub@@ po@@ ena people for ques@@ tioning under o@@ ath .
According to the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N , sub@@ po@@ en@@ as have already been issued in relation to a meeting between Donald Trump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
People who had been involved in this meeting had been sum@@ mon@@ ed to give evidence , the report said .
They were also supposed to make documents available .
In addition to Trump J@@ r . , Trump 's adv@@ iser and son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also present at the meeting .
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the conven@@ ing shows that Mu@@ eller will not let himself be in@@ tim@@ i@@ dated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly , should that be necessary .
However , this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges .
Nevertheless , the conven@@ ing of the panel signals the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and gives President Trump a new cause for concern .
In the midst of these new re@@ vel@@ ations , the President took advantage of a speech in West Vir@@ g@@ inia on Thursday evening in order to portra@@ y the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
" The Russia story is a total fabri@@ cation , " said Trump .
He said the subject gives Democrats an opportunity " to feel better when they have nothing else to talk about . "
His special adv@@ iser T@@ y Co@@ b@@ b explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the conven@@ ing of a grand jury .
But it usually operates in secret , he stressed .
The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Coun@@ sel in a " fair " way .
Former head of the F@@ BI James Com@@ ey said three times that the President was not under investigation , he said .
There is no reason to pre@@ su@@ me that anything has changed , his statement continued .
However , Mu@@ eller was only engaged after Trump had fi@@ red Com@@ ey .
Due to the sac@@ king , acc@@ us@@ ations were raised that he wanted to ob@@ struc@@ t the course of justice .
Com@@ ey stated before a Sen@@ ate committee in June that Trump had asked him to put an end to the investigations into former national security adv@@ iser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
The President was under a lot of pressure because of the investigation .
As the US media portra@@ ys it , the White House gathered materials against the Special Coun@@ sel and his colleagues .
This gave rise to spec@@ ulations about whether Trump wanted to dis@@ miss Mu@@ eller .
Unlike an independent Special Coun@@ sel of Congress , such as , for example , in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate sc@@ andal concerning President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , who later step@@ ped down , Mu@@ eller is in a position where , in theory , he could be fi@@ red by the justice department if the President push@@ ed for it .
However , various sen@@ ators , from both parties , want to avoid such a move .
Two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Coun@@ sel to be dis@@ missed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : Gi@@ gan@@ tic ic@@ e@@ berg dri@@ fts into the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
In the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigan@@ tic ic@@ e@@ berg almost seven times the size of Berlin has det@@ ached from the ice sh@@ elf .
The Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Pol@@ ar and Marine Research in Bre@@ mer@@ haven communic@@ ated this on Wednesday .
The over a tri@@ l@@ lion @@@ -@@ @ ton @@@ -@@ @ heavy and 5@@ 800 @@@ -@@ @ square @@@ -@@ @ kilomet@@ re @@@ -@@ @ big colo@@ s@@ sus is now dri@@ fting to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt .
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades .
It does not pose any danger for men .
The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the ic@@ e@@ berg breaking off is un@@ clear from the research scientists ' findings .
Nevertheless , al@@ together , there have been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of ice shel@@ ves in the region for around 30 years now , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a background fact report .
Many researchers believe this could be connected to global warming .
The now det@@ ached colo@@ s@@ sus was previously a part of the Lar@@ sen C ice sh@@ elf .
S@@ hel@@ f ice flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
It thereby gro@@ ws out ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
The Lar@@ sen C ice sh@@ elf is located south of South America , almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
The equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um between growing and breaking off became dis@@ rupted north of this ice sh@@ elf a few years ago .
An entire ice sh@@ elf cru@@ m@@ bled there , writes AW@@ I resear@@ cher Daniel@@ a Jan@@ sen .
There is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen C ice sh@@ elf is in danger too , for the front edge has never re@@ treated so far back as it currently is .
What is more , the ice sheet is under tension and could cru@@ m@@ ble if a piece breaks off at a key point .
The mel@@ ting of sh@@ elf ice and ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs do not raise sea water levels , since they flo@@ at on the water and ice disp@@ l@@ aces as much water as it itself produces after mel@@ ting .
However , the loss of the ice sh@@ elf leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers feeding directly into the sea , and being able to flow out much faster than before .
The could potentially raise sea water levels , though only to a small degree , writes the British research project for monitoring the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
According to information from the AW@@ I , the Lar@@ sen C ice sh@@ elf , at almost 50@@ ,000 square metres , is the fourth biggest ice sh@@ elf in Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
It is up to 700 metres thick where it meets the main@@ land , and around 200 metres at the front edge to the open ocean .
It regularly breaks off there .
" Although this is a natural event , and we 're not aware of any direct link to climate change , this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position , " says Martin O '@@ Lear@@ y from Britain 's S@@ wan@@ sea University .
" This is the fur@@ th@@ est back that it has been since records began , " he also confirmed .
There is dis@@ agreement among scientists as to whether the Lar@@ sen C ice sh@@ elf will now grow again or whether it is rec@@ eding long term and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adri@@ an Lu@@ ck@@ man , adding : " Our models say it will be less stable . "
But this development will take decades .
Even if these researchers do not attri@@ bute the break @@@ -@@ @ off of this gigan@@ tic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , nevertheless , very many ice shel@@ fs in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have cru@@ m@@ bled in recent decades .
This long tail of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stret@@ ches towards South America .
According to data from the research programme the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the ice surface area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has dec@@ lined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950@@ s .
The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline .
The Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has war@@ med up by around three degrees in the last 50 years and is amongst those areas where temperatures are rising most quickly .
CD@@ U want in @@@ -@@ @ house wage agreement for staff
Since it is get@@ ter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available , the CD@@ U is calling for sec@@ ession from the employers ' association , so as to become more attractive .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before the Summer rec@@ ess , the district assembly rubber @@@ -@@ @ st@@ amp@@ ed 41 new posts in the administration .
More than 1100 permanent staff members and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
Now another 17 tra@@ ine@@ es once more have their first working day behind them .
The app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip positions at the district are apparently very co@@ v@@ eted .
There were around 6@@ 20 applications recorded for the places on offer this year .
However , the district is lacking additional personnel which it needs to overcome growing demands and duties .
Currently there are 50 positions at the district of M@@ ett@@ mann that are still un@@ filled .
S@@ ought after are , among others , doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff .
The CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G , now wants to sei@@ ze the initiative in the district assembly and counter the de@@ ar@@ th of skilled workers in the administration .
The administration is to " work out a plan for acqu@@ iring and developing staff , " in line with the wishes of the parties .
The plan is not only to satisfy short @@@ -@@ @ term demand in skilled workers , but , with a view to the future , to counter@@ act the short@@ age of applicants , it is reported .
The entire concept should focus intern@@ ally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for later@@ al entry employees , and include a training offen@@ sive , demand the CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
Well that does sound like a good approach .
For the district has sta@@ ff@@ ing problems , the li@@ kes of which it has not seen before .
Other cities po@@ ach good officials and staff members and offer attractive conditions .
The talk is of a down@@ right " contest between public employers . "
In addition , a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age .
High time to act then , so that not even more positions remain un@@ filled .
Yet Klaus @@@ -@@ @ Dieter Völker , parliamentary group leader of the CD@@ U , is , with his party , going even beyond the joint request .
Just recently he caused a huge surprise in the district assembly when he publicly called the staff c@@ apping into question and star@@ t@@ led the other parties .
Völker wants all av@@ en@@ ues to be examined that enable a sec@@ ession from the municipal employers ' association .
" If we don 't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration should strive with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the district 's towns - to secure an in @@@ -@@ @ house wage agreement , " said Völker .
The CD@@ U are thereby attemp@@ ting to pay the permanent staff and officials better than the pay @@@ -@@ @ scale for public sector workers actually allows for .
Sal@@ aries are currently prescri@@ bed exactly , and there are only raises or more money when moves into a more senior level , which is based on years experience .
Yet the district 's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years .
For the first time a few weeks ago , new premises had to be er@@ ected for staff to tackle the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitutes Protection Act .
Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum , County Commissioner Thomas H@@ end@@ ele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy tou@@ gh@@ ens tone on NG@@ O migrant rescue boats
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations .
" If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue operating , " Interior Minister Marco M@@ inn@@ iti said in an interview with Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
M@@ inn@@ iti 's warning came a day after Italian authorities im@@ po@@ und@@ ed a boat operated by German aid organis@@ ati@@ ion Jugend Ret@@ tet on suspi@@ ci@@ on its crew effectively collabor@@ ated with people traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
The aid organisation , which has only been operational for a year , dec@@ lined to comment on the substance of detailed alleg@@ ations made against it by Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
" For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority , so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " the organisation said in a statement on social media .
" We can only assess all the acc@@ us@@ ations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation . "
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Ret@@ tet 's boat , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
Its crew is susp@@ ected to taking on board din@@ gh@@ y loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffi@@ ckers and allowing the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers to make off with the vessels to be used again .
At least one such meeting alle@@ ge@@ dly took place only 1.3 miles off the Liby@@ an coast , according to the prosec@@ utor 's file , the contents of which were published by Italian media .
The crew are susp@@ ected of having fl@@ ou@@ ted the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , which over@@ sees rescue operations in the zone , out of humanitarian ze@@ al rather than for any other mo@@ tives .
Under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities .
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to ab@@ ide by the code : Save The Children , Malta @@@ -@@ @ based MO@@ AS and Spain 's Pro @@@ -@@ @ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms .
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any " significant change or impe@@ di@@ ment " to its rescue operations .
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize @@@ -@@ @ winning organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
M@@ inn@@ iti mean@@ while said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following res@@ cu@@ es was an indication that efforts to beef up the Liby@@ an coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors was bearing fruit .
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Liby@@ an may@@ ors on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Ni@@ ger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
Asc@@ ents and trials
N@@ ine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the " Berlin out@@ post , " and two guest ri@@ ders met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions .
Three ch@@ um@@ my guides were on hand for this .
The accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Wach@@ en@@ heim 's Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .
The first tour led along the vineyards , ami@@ d@@ st hot summer temperatures , to the Chap@@ el of St. Michael above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
There followed viewing spots , some on to@@ wers , from which one could look far and wide over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream pla@@ ins .
In between , there were time and again long u@@ phil@@ l climb@@ s , for which long trials were the re@@ ward .
On the second day , they went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , to the salt works and to the Wur@@ st@@ markt festival .
Again , there came v@@ ant@@ age point after v@@ ant@@ age point , str@@ ung together with " f@@ lowing " trials and moderate as@@ c@@ ents .
On the last two days , lots of high al@@ ti@@ tudes were on the cards again .
C@@ aves , rocks , to@@ wers , cast@@ les , ruins and refresh@@ ment cab@@ ins brought welcome p@@ auses .
In Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed in healing salt water in the open @@@ -@@ @ air inhal@@ atorium .

Con@@ sole instead of tur@@ f - Bundes@@ lig@@ a is getting ready for e @@@ -@@ @ sport
Will the sports stars of the future sit in front of computer con@@ sol@@ es instead of batt@@ ling swe@@ ati@@ ly , come wind or rain , on the stadium tur@@ f ?
The fact is , e @@@ -@@ @ sport has long been a credible industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tour@@ naments , complete with big sal@@ aries .
Even the top Bundes@@ lig@@ a clubs have recognised this , and are getting more and more involved in this area .
V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg took the lead in 2015 , followed later by FC Schal@@ ke 04 , and most recently by V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @@@ -@@ @ sport department in the middle of July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game F@@ IFA 17 .
" By doing this , we hope to get completely new , young target groups fi@@ red up about the V@@ f@@ B , " says board member Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
He is sure " that countless more clubs are getting on board this train . "
The world football association , F@@ IFA , is organising the first " Interactive Club World Cup " this coming weekend in London , which will see gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
Al@@ ongside Schal@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @@@ -@@ @ Ger@@ main and PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified , to give some examples .
Rob@@ in D@@ ut@@ t also sees great potential in e @@@ -@@ @ sport .
The ex @@@ -@@ @ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ us@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
" Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 @@@ -@@ @ 30 year ol@@ ds , so that the young people still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
And : the clubs are trying to conqu@@ er all possible markets , above all the Asian ones .
With prominent e @@@ -@@ @ sport@@ spe@@ ople under contract , it would be possible to be present online in these markets v@@ ast@@ ly more often than the mere once a year the national team gets sent to Asia .
What exactly is it about ?
In e @@@ -@@ @ sport , computer games like " League Of Le@@ gen@@ ds , " " Do@@ ta 2 , " " Co@@ unter@@ strike " or even the football simul@@ ator F@@ IFA are batt@@ led out on a competitive level .
Just like in the regular sport , le@@ agues have long been established , in which the pro@@ s compete against one another .
And for the 2022 Asian Games , e @@@ -@@ @ sport is already part of the official programme .
But is it even a real sport ?
For many people , this notion certainly takes some getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ öse also grap@@ pled with this question for a long time .
For the professor at the German Sports University of Cologne , e @@@ -@@ @ sport is a sport , because it is competitive and features many biological and physical reactions that one also finds in classic sport - for example , a raised heart rate , stress responses , hormon@@ al changes .
In addition , it requires co@@ gni@@ tive capabilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and an ability to react quickly .
Professional gam@@ ers ought to train not only on the con@@ sole , but also their bodies , and should pay attention to their diet .
" A fit player is a good player . "
F@@ rob@@ öse sees problems too though : " D@@ op@@ ing is becoming more and more of an issue . "
For online games it is difficult to implement testing , and the scene is lacking the structures of the classic sport .
The scienti@@ st posi@@ tively stresses the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @@@ -@@ @ sport .
The players travel internationally , it is like a big global family , and there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
A study from consul@@ tancy firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for the e @@@ -@@ @ sport .
In 2016 , it turned over 50 million euros in Germany , many through advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ship and big tour@@ naments .
In three years , the turnover should total 130 million .
Comp@@ ared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundes@@ lig@@ a that is ad@@ mit@@ tedly sc@@ ant .
However , the e @@@ -@@ @ sport is " no longer far off other established sports like hand@@ ball , bas@@ ketball or ice ho@@ ckey , " write the Del@@ o@@ itte consul@@ tants .
Many countries internationally are already further ahead .
Big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @@@ -@@ @ bas@@ ketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O '@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all star Alex Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez are involved in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton K@@ ut@@ cher is investing in the e @@@ -@@ @ sport book@@ maker Uni@@ k@@ r@@ n .
In Europe too , quite a bit is happening .
E @@@ -@@ @ sport has been introduced to the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ öse .
In the Netherlands and in France , the top division football clubs are now committed to setting up an e @@@ -@@ @ sport department , according to D@@ ut@@ t .
" Comp@@ ared with the rest of Europe , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , " decla@@ res V@@ f@@ B board member , Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
Simply to slide back into no@@ stal@@ gia and roman@@ tic@@ ise the old days is no longer enough these days .
It 's about preser@@ ving the tradition of the club while at the same time align@@ ing the business with the modern market .
" We are living in a dig@@ itali@@ sed world , " says D@@ ut@@ t as well .
" So you can 't c@@ ling on to the idea that only in football , everything stays as it always was . "

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced for texts ur@@ ging su@@ ici@@ de of Con@@ rad Ro@@ y
A Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her bo@@ y@@ friend to commit su@@ ici@@ de through texts and phone calls .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June of the invol@@ un@@ tary man@@ slau@@ ghter of Con@@ rad Ro@@ y , who took his own life on 13 July 2014 .
Mr Ro@@ y 's father told Thursday 's hearing : " My family is hear@@ t@@ broken .
My son was my best friend . "
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal .
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Ro@@ y suffered from mental illness .
Dres@@ sed in red tro@@ users and a cream bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood te@@ ar@@ fully with hands c@@ las@@ ped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced .
" Her actions killed Con@@ rad Ro@@ y , " the prosec@@ utor told the court .
" She ended his life to better her own .
She has not accepted responsibility , " she said .
" She has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . "
But Car@@ ter 's lawyer said it was a " hor@@ ri@@ ble circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . "
However , Ju@@ dge Law@@ rence Mon@@ i@@ z said he did not find that her " age or level of mat@@ urity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions . "
A prosec@@ utor read a statement from Mr Ro@@ y 's mother , L@@ ynn Ro@@ y , saying there was " not one day I do not mo@@ ur@@ n the loss of my bel@@ o@@ ved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for et@@ ernity , " it said .
Mr Ro@@ y 's sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Ro@@ y , t@@ esti@@ fied that she was " ha@@ un@@ ted " by the re@@ alisation that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be an a@@ unt to his children .
" Not having that one person I 've been with every day since birth is a pain I 'll always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .
The case appears to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts law that crimin@@ ali@@ ses telling a person to commit su@@ ici@@ de .
Car@@ ter was 17 when Mr Ro@@ y was found dead of carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
The case drew national attention after Car@@ ter 's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life .
" H@@ ang yourself , jum@@ p off a building , stab yourself I don 't know there 's a lot of ways , " she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
In the moments before his su@@ ici@@ de , she wrote : " You need to do it , Con@@ rad " and " All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy . "
Ju@@ dge Mon@@ i@@ z said Car@@ ter sought attention through Mr Ro@@ y 's death , or@@ dering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press .
The case has divided legal opinion .
Among the few to defend Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of mur@@ dering her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy in 2007 before she was cle@@ ared two years ago .
Ms Kno@@ x , 30 , published an op @@@ -@@ @ ed in the Los Angeles Times saying : " Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves symp@@ athy and help , not prison . "
Jo@@ sh@@ ua K@@ im@@ mich : Learning from FC Bayern 's new mini L@@ ah@@ m
It is no coinci@@ dence that Jo@@ sh@@ ua K@@ im@@ mich was allowed to take to the field as cap@@ tain at the Audi Cup .
FC Bayern thinks the Con@@ feder@@ ations Cup winner is capable of a big season - a bit of extra motivation doesn 't h@@ urt .
Some@@ thing was different there at his place in the dres@@ sing room ; Jo@@ sh@@ ua K@@ im@@ mich noticed that immediately , even if the extra piece of kit was very , very small .
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m anywhere to be seen , and no Manuel Neu@@ er either , he simply put the band he 'd been allocated on his arm .
" The coach didn 't announce it , " explained the Con@@ feder@@ ations Cup winner later , after his first ou@@ ting as Bayern cap@@ tain .
S@@ ure , the debut could have gone better than the 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Nap@@ oli .
But K@@ im@@ mich could also interpre@@ t the signal from the coach as follows .
Out of the C team of youth players , deb@@ ut@@ ants and pro@@ s just back from the holidays , it was not the eight @@@ -@@ @ years @@@ -@@ @ older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal that was chosen as cap@@ tain , but him .
Indeed , it is those that one thinks capable , those who one wants to keep happy that one li@@ kes to give tre@@ ats to the most .
And anyone chosen to take on the man@@ tel of L@@ ah@@ m can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation .
K@@ im@@ mich confirmed : " That is what one wants as a player : to take on responsibility . "
The 22 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old dar@@ ted over the field like a mini L@@ ah@@ m on Wednesday .
Right back , that 's his position now ; the white ar@@ mb@@ and cast its habit@@ ual sp@@ ell .
And in general , K@@ im@@ mich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the hel@@ m .
He gave instructions , attemp@@ ted to ste@@ er the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ practice tro@@ op .
He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were bu@@ si@@ ed with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to cover up his lack of fitness ( didn 't really work ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip ( worked , but to a limited extent ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to not make a negative impression on their first out@@ ings in the Bayern jer@@ sey .
That worked out quite well though .
Sü@@ le took to the field alongside K@@ im@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defence - both performed excell@@ ently .
The renowned Nap@@ oli attack often made heavy weather of it , and on top of that , Sü@@ le made a couple of successful attempts as the game developed .
His team mate , Ru@@ dy , admitted that the result " was not what we had hoped for . "
But he too showed a decent performance on his debut .
Shi@@ fting play , changing pace : " That 's the style I was brought in for . "
Just how un@@ used to new arri@@ vals this Bayern world is could be seen after the match .
Ru@@ dy , for example , gave not one or two , but as many as six or seven interviews in the t@@ unn@@ els .
K@@ im@@ mich took his leave after a few c@@ ris@@ p remarks in support of his new team m@@ ates .
There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Sü@@ le there : " I 've already noticed what went wrong here .
At Bayern , you just have to win every game . "
He doesn 't have to teach the new@@ bies that anymore though .
Al@@ aba mo@@ tiv@@ ates the Ö@@ F@@ B women
David Al@@ aba believes our Ö@@ F@@ B women will be successful
Austria 's most famous foot@@ b@@ aller spoke up shortly before the game and wish@@ ed the Ö@@ F@@ B women all the best .
The Bayern legi@@ onn@@ aire is , after all , practically a club mate of the Ö@@ F@@ B cap@@ tain Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck , and che@@ ers our ladies on .
The t@@ we@@ et from the Austrian Foot@@ b@@ aller of the Year and Champi@@ ons League winner was intended to give a special injection of motivation .
Our ladies could perhaps also do with a bit of that famous Bayern luck .
Companies happy with Rhin@@ eland @@@ -@@ @ Pal@@ at@@ inate minister : Industry pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing 's speed
The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able when Ev@@ al@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( The Greens ) was still Rhin@@ eland Pal@@ at@@ inate 's Economic Affairs Minister .
This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister , Vol@@ ker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) being in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region are responding to a TV en@@ quiry by speaking of a change in economic policy - and at the same time re@@ bu@@ ke the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the association of Tri@@ er companies Vereinigung Tri@@ erer Unternehmen ( V@@ TU ) says : " Wis@@ sing is addressing the wishes of the industry , all of which Lem@@ ke blocked . "
Nat@@ us considers the biggest U @@@ -@@ @ turn to be in infrastructure policy : linking the A1 motorway between Kel@@ ber and A@@ den@@ au is now right at the top of the state 's list of priorities .
The Ministry hopes that planning procedures will be in place this year already , and the construction rights should hold until 2021 .
The Tri@@ er western b@@ yp@@ ass also plays a role in the state 's plans , being in the priority need category of The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan .
The goal is to put the stret@@ ch into service in December 2020 , says mini@@ stry spo@@ kes@@ person Corne@@ lia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in this a road@@ map for supporting regional , but internationally competitive , companies .
The Tri@@ er Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ H@@ K ) is stri@@ ving , as sp@@ urred on by Wis@@ sing , to achieve a Rhin@@ eland @@@ -@@ @ Pal@@ at@@ inate label for wine , in order to increase sales in super@@ markets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sag@@ ging German wine exports .
In addition , Wis@@ sing is said to have a symp@@ a@@ thetic ear for people who want to found their own company , the I@@ H@@ K appl@@ au@@ ded .
The Tri@@ er Chamber of Tra@@ des sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ ine@@ es in the new master bonus , says manager Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master cra@@ fts@@ man examination , and 2500 euros if gradu@@ ates become self @@@ -@@ @ employed within ten years of their master cra@@ fts@@ man training .
The state 's list of hom@@ e@@ work assign@@ ments remains long though .
Fac@@ ts have to presented quickly for the road construction planned , and at the same time the state is lacking the necessary human resources , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Tri@@ er I@@ H@@ K .
Of the 56 new engineers that Wis@@ sing wants to emplo@@ y at the Federal State Office for Mobility , only 29 posts have been filled thus far .
The I@@ H@@ K is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .
Deputy leader of the CD@@ U parliamentary fac@@ tion Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calcul@@ ations from the Court of Auditors : in 2017 and 2018 , the state is investing more than 20 million euros less on maintaining federal state roads than recommended .
Frank Nat@@ us is also still exp@@ ecting the state to put forward a policy as to how it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region .
Also so@@ ber@@ ing is the expansion of broadband in the state up until now .
In 2016 , in an I@@ H@@ K survey , local companies had evaluated the ma@@ ins supply with a mark of only 3.4 .
They compla@@ ined about s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish internet connections and out@@ ages .
Ex @@@ -@@ @ Minister of Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind .
Lem@@ ke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - from where , after four months , she has already bid a re@@ treat due to dis@@ agreements .
Audi to Modi@@ fy Up to 8@@ 50@@ ,000 Diesel Vehicles as Car@@ makers F@@ ace Bac@@ kl@@ ash
A day before Audi 's announcement , BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
The BMW chairman said the company believed " there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , " referring to the European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - that have considered b@@ anning or restric@@ ting diesel vehicles .
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .
N@@ one of the companies described the moves as rec@@ alls .
European car@@ makers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
But the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des that diesel engines em@@ it are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens , and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutrali@@ ze the f@@ umes emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
As German autom@@ ak@@ ers face scrutiny , the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of co@@ dd@@ ling the powerful car companies and of ign@@ oring signs of the problem .
The companies are trying to avoid repe@@ ating the mistakes of Volkswagen , which covered up its use of so @@@ -@@ @ called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested , but ease back in normal driving conditions .
Several Volkswagen exec@@ u@@ tives have been charged in the United States , and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics at Audi 's engine development department was arrested in Germany .
The former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian , and therefore is not protected from ex@@ tradition and could face trial in the United States .
Early this year , Audi was swe@@ pt up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to ev@@ ade emissions rules in Europe , broad@@ ening an inquiry that had focused on the United States .
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could wei@@ gh heavily on Volkswagen : The luxury car@@ maker accounts for a dis@@ proportionate share of Volkswagen 's profit .
The raft on the Is@@ ar had this message on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
So that visitors to Is@@ ar play their part , a raft trav@@ elled through Munich on Saturday morning with a special message .
Any@@ one drawn to the Is@@ ar again on Saturday will see a large raft there , between F@@ lau@@ cher and the Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge .
An no normal raft that is , with Is@@ ar tourists .
Rather , the building department wants to get a message across .
There is a large information b@@ anner to be seen on the raft .
It depic@@ ts a mountain of rub@@ b@@ ish .
The pre@@ lu@@ de to a public@@ ity campaign that wants to call upon visitors to Is@@ ar .
Using the motto " True love is .@@ .. , " the aim is to strengthen understanding for the Is@@ ar as a wild river deser@@ ving of protection .
Last summer , the raft trav@@ elled over the Is@@ ar already , and this year too , there are further campaigns and measures to bring about thou@@ ghtful and environmentally aware behaviour .
Mor@@ di@@ llo 's bul@@ b@@ ous no@@ ses and lau@@ gh@@ ing in the face of sor@@ row
Mor@@ di@@ llo was for a while one of the most @@@ -@@ @ published car@@ to@@ oni@@ sts ; his figures ' bul@@ b@@ ous no@@ ses are his trade mark .
Even at 85 , the Argent@@ inian still draws and is working on a film .
His message : Lau@@ gh@@ ing , " Because there 's too much sor@@ row in the world . "
Gu@@ iller@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4th August 1932 in Buenos Aires , the son of a Spanish im@@ migrant .
In his first years as an artist he strugg@@ led along as an illustr@@ ator for celebration cards , amongst other things - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
" The happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day I lost my job , " he once said .
Following posts in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60@@ s he finally got his break@@ through : when his cartoons were published in " Paris Mat@@ ch " and then in the " Stern " as well , and other leading magazines around the world .
Even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
The artist always let himself be inspired by cities .
Large , rounded Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t around in his drawings with the le@@ an@@ ing tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
In the early morning , he si@@ ts at his drawing desk , still today according to his own statements , and works almost ten hours a day .
On cal@@ end@@ ars , pu@@ zzles , books for young and old , t @@@ -@@ @ shi@@ rts , soft toys and clo@@ cks , his whi@@ m@@ sical figures are still dis@@ semin@@ ated widely around the world .
In addition , he has been working for six years on an anim@@ ated film and a TV series with his figures .
The main character in the film " Cra@@ zy Island " is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ di@@ llo 's favourite animal in his drawings - who has a milli@@ pe@@ de as his n@@ em@@ e@@ sis .
His figures are speaking for the first time in the 3D film , which should hit cinema screens in 2019 .
" I don 't know exactly what they are going to say ; it is od@@ d for me , " says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
The scre@@ en@@ play was not written by him .
Therefore he is foc@@ uss@@ ing rather on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is being produced without words .
Provence la@@ ven@@ der under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it 's under threat from climate change .
Lav@@ ender is in decline because of d@@ rought @@@ -@@ @ like conditions and disease @@@ -@@ @ carrying in@@ sec@@ ts , causing a major head@@ ache for scientists and farmers attemp@@ ting to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert at the Provence @@@ -@@ @ based agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM , said : " Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed , because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn .
This affects the li@@ fes@@ p@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
There 's also a small ci@@ c@@ ada , a micro @@@ -@@ @ bacteria trans@@ mitting lea@@ f hop@@ per , and in very dry weather there are lots of them . "
And a lot is at stake .
As well as attrac@@ ting holi@@ day@@ makers , la@@ ven@@ der oil is highly sought after for perf@@ ume and cosme@@ tics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers , we have smaller ones , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . "
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and s@@ lowing down ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of cla@@ y and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions .

A journalist 's murder under@@ scores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meets on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for coverage of the most recent may@@ hem w@@ rought in Sin@@ alo@@ a state by organized crime , cor@@ rupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they 've come together to talk about security .
It 's important to change their rout@@ ines , they are told .
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a gr@@ en@@ ade attack in 2009 , or to leave them at home .
Security experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ aries , neut@@ r@@ als , allies .
They ask the re@@ por@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
There are drug @@@ -@@ @ traffi@@ ckers , politicians , busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , journalists susp@@ ected of being on the pay@@ roll of the government or the car@@ tels , a catalog of vil@@ la@@ ins who make the job of covering Mexico 's ch@@ aos per@@ il@@ ous .
There is no resp@@ ite from the violence , and as bodies pi@@ le up across the country , more and more of them are journalists : at least 25 since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to took office in December 2012 , according to the Committee to Prot@@ ect Journ@@ alists ; 5@@ 89 under federal protection after attacks and threats ; and so far this year , at least seven dead in seven states .
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co @@@ -@@ @ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
" The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , " Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on nar@@ co @@@ -@@ @ violence .
His absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez displa@@ ying his middle finger , with the word " Justice , " han@@ gs on the fac@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building ; two re@@ por@@ ters on their 30@@ s , Aar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @@@ -@@ @ shi@@ rts that display his sm@@ iling , bes@@ p@@ ec@@ tac@@ led face or his trademark Panama hat .
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death ; the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared trau@@ ma , their night@@ ma@@ res , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
Although a special federal prosec@@ utor 's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists ' cases , it has only prosec@@ uted two , according to the Committee to Prot@@ ect Journ@@ alists .
As with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year , the k@@ ill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
At Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they persi@@ st in covering the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , though they are hear@@ t@@ broken , though the terra@@ in is more tre@@ ach@@ erous now .
Without information on the k@@ ill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
" It 's very foo@@ li@@ sh to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .
" As long as we don 't know why , you di@@ str@@ ust everyone . "
On the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men ; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , pre@@ sum@@ ably for the name of the paper - which transl@@ ates as T@@ wel@@ f@@ th River .
The g@@ un@@ man dro@@ ve away in his car and cra@@ shed it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
He left a wife and two adult children .
Rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
But on the subject of Val@@ dez , there 's practically nothing but silence .
Since Gu@@ z@@ man 's arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has been one of the country 's b@@ loo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ grounds as ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight to fill the vacuum .
Ne@@ ver mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sin@@ alo@@ a , or that the c@@ emetery is filled with or@@ n@@ ate , two @@@ -@@ @ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug k@@ ings , larger than many homes for the living .
For@@ get for a minute that a state of " calm " is when just one car@@ tel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug @@@ -@@ @ trafficking routes to the United States .
Despite that , and the fact that Val@@ dez was in@@ timately aware of the per@@ ils of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , 60 , a co @@@ -@@ @ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , is wra@@ cked with gu@@ ilt for failing to protect his friend .
He believes two errors contributed to the killing .
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val car@@ tel fac@@ tions at war with Gu@@ z@@ man 's sons .
The piece may have anger@@ ed the sons ; susp@@ ected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to news@@ stands .
The second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that carried the same story .
Val@@ dez was a le@@ gend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
He 'd survi@@ ved for so long , his friends and colleagues assumed he 'd always be there .
He was a veter@@ an re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling $ 50 shares .
In Sin@@ alo@@ a , " it was impossible to do journ@@ alism without tou@@ ching the nar@@ co issue , " said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
Over time the paper earned a reputation for bra@@ ve and honest coverage , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters loved being able to publish hard @@@ -@@ @ hit@@ ting investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else da@@ red to cover .
Ei@@ ght years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , it won the prestigious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ abo@@ t award for coverage in Latin America .
That same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Prot@@ ect Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led .
He freely acknowledged that he was fri@@ gh@@ tened .
" I want to carry on living , " he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
Dru@@ g trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a " is a way of life , " he said last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
" You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play du@@ mb .
I don 't want to be asked , ' What were you doing in the face of so much death .@@ .. why didn 't you say what was going on ? ' "
The Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the jo@@ k@@ ester who s@@ wor@@ e like a long@@ sho@@ re@@ man , the friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They reli@@ ed on his routine .
He would always wear his hat .
He would go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
Now , they ask : Was his love of routine his down@@ fall ?
His death also has forced them to question their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive .
" They don 't like it if you m@@ ess with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine air@@ stri@@ ps " used to move drugs .
" Those things were off @@@ -@@ @ limits , " said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
The result is , even in the best of times , a high @@@ -@@ @ level of self @@@ -@@ @ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @@@ -@@ @ preservation .
Tru@@ sting one 's inst@@ inc@@ ts .
If it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
The trouble , said Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce editor And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , is that " sm@@ ell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed .@@ .. and then the thing with Javier happened . "
The old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as they don 't in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling routes , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government officials .
The landscape constantly shi@@ fts .
In the room where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed ; days before , it was revealed that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
Out@@ side , two police officers sought relief from the 104 @@@ -@@ @ degree ( 40 Celsius ) heat in the sha@@ de of a tree .
They were assigned by the state government to guard Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce 's offices , hous@@ ed in a four @@@ -@@ @ story building in a middle @@@ -@@ @ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
Hal@@ f @@@ -@@ @ jo@@ k@@ ingly , some of the re@@ por@@ ters wonder@@ ed whether these officers are among the 50 percent of c@@ ops whom the govern@@ or himself has said are not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
It has been months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain@@ ous countryside , where the drug gangs are in de facto control .
For this week 's edition Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stories .
There was the killing of former bo@@ x@@ ing great Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ ve@@ z 's brother in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
They also had an ex@@ pose on government spending concentrated in the govern@@ or 's hom@@ et@@ own .
And there was a group ki@@ dn@@ apping in one of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an 's most expensive restaurants , a block from the prosec@@ utor 's office .
There was no official word on who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so cau@@ tion set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
A re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party , or PR@@ I , which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century .
Rec@@ ently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption in high @@@ -@@ @ profile cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about prior inci@@ dents in that loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of " El Chap@@ o " Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed a military raid .
Just months before , readers would have looked to Val@@ dez 's column for the best @@@ -@@ @ sour@@ ced information about the ki@@ dn@@ apping .
" Before , we would have already known what happened , " said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named " El Fl@@ aco " for his sl@@ ender build .
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . "
Val@@ dez 's office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers pro@@ testing journalist k@@ ill@@ ings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosec@@ utor 's office over yet another journalist .
Salvador Ad@@ ame dis@@ appeared in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an three days after Val@@ dez was killed .
A bur@@ ned body has been discovered and officials say it is his , based on DNA tests .
Nation@@ wide , journalists have become more vo@@ cal , scra@@ w@@ ling " S@@ OS Press " on si@@ de@@ walks and buildings in organized protests .
On this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington , trying to rally international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
At a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after Val@@ dez was killed , R@@ ami@@ rez accused authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth .
She has since asked to be reas@@ signed from covering the government , concerned that her anger has h@@ urt her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organized crime , complic@@ it government officials and an in@@ different society .
In his last book , " Nar@@ co @@@ -@@ @ journ@@ alism , " he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in c@@ ah@@ oo@@ ts with organized crime .
The media wat@@ ch@@ dog group Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 attri@@ buted more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials .
" In Mexico you die because they want to sh@@ ut you up , " R@@ ami@@ rez said .
Cle@@ arly , the mur@@ ders have a ch@@ illing effect .
No one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as .
Her body was found along with a note pur@@ porte@@ dly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : " Here I am because of my reports . "
A computer keyboard and head@@ phones lay next to her sever@@ ed head .
Some out@@ lets have op@@ ted to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the killing of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
O@@ thers keep going , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do did following the killing of its director in 2004 .
In 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug car@@ tels publicly with a front @@@ -@@ @ page edi@@ torial tit@@ led , " What do you want from us ? "
Some journalists have fl@@ ed their home states or even the country .
It 's a w@@ ren@@ ching decision .
It 's hard to find work in exi@@ le , and they still scan the streets , looking for danger .
And sometimes , they are hun@@ ted down , as apparently was photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was mur@@ dered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fle@@ eing Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
For those who stay behind and continue the work , it 's a daily dance of high @@@ -@@ @ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra - who once wanted to be a po@@ et - ad@@ mits that covering the drug trade sc@@ ares him .
" Mexico is going to hell , and that 's why I became a re@@ porter , " he said .
At mid@@ night on a recent Friday , with the latest issue already put to bed , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edi@@ tors sat on the si@@ de@@ walk outside the office , drinking beer , when all at once , their phones began to bu@@ z@@ z .
A series of sho@@ ot@@ outs involving gang ri@@ vals and security forces near the beach resort city of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
The war continued to escal@@ ate , as was promised by a series of car@@ tel messages discovered in the area .
From the cur@@ b , via cell@@ phone , they put the news up on Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce 's website .
The front page would have to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens wa@@ iled nearby - another sho@@ ot@@ out in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez g@@ lan@@ ced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were al@@ ert .
If they were at all afraid , they didn 't show it .
Bene@@ ath the massive portrait of their newspaper 's fallen founder , his middle finger displayed for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a to see , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was following in his foot@@ steps .
" How can you even think of closing , " Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , " when the same day Javier was killed the inter@@ n asked me to send her out to report on the street ? "
Din@@ os@@ au@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
At first glance , it looks like a stat@@ ue alb@@ eit a terri@@ fying one .
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible r@@ hin@@ o @@@ -@@ @ sized creature found by a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved experts have described it as ' the Mon@@ a Lis@@ a of din@@ os@@ au@@ rs ' .
It was so well preserved , they were even able to determine the colour of its sc@@ aly skin was a red@@ dish brown - and say it had something of a ' troub@@ led past ' .
The report in the journal Current Bi@@ ology described it as ' the best @@@ -@@ @ preserved ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens in the world . ' 
The fossil is a new@@ found species of no@@ do@@ sau@@ r , which lived mid@@ way through the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
It 's incredible well preserved state has st@@ un@@ ned researchers , who describe it as ' truly remark@@ ab@@ le@@ '
The arm@@ oured plant @@@ -@@ @ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found , according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic .
It was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ eni@@ um M@@ ine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to take a closer look .
The fossil he un@@ covered was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
They spent the next six years working on un@@ covering the be@@ ast within the 2,@@ 500 @@@ -@@ @ po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) l@@ um@@ p of earth .
After all that hard work , the finished result is now ready to be un@@ v@@ ei@@ led .
'@@ If you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sleeping , ' said lead author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a scienti@@ st at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is on display .
'@@ It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lis@@ a of din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . ' 
By studying its skin , researchers found that this plant @@@ -@@ @ e@@ ater , though covered in arm@@ or and res@@ em@@ bling a walking tank , likely faced a significant threat from meat @@@ -@@ @ eating din@@ os@@ au@@ rs .
The heavily arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r used red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and employed a shi@@ el@@ ding technique known as counter @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern @@@ -@@ @ day animals .
This would have allowed it to better bl@@ end into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , sugge@@ sting it was pre@@ yed on by larger din@@ os@@ au@@ rs .
The 110 @@@ -@@ @ million @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old creature , part of the no@@ do@@ sau@@ r family , first hit head@@ lines in May and is now on view at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
Res@@ ear@@ chers have now studied and named the be@@ ast Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after museum techni@@ cian Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours pain@@ stak@@ ingly un@@ covering it .
The amazing preservation of the spec@@ im@@ en made it possible for Dr Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our across its body .
They discovered counter@@ sh@@ ading , a common method of defence in the animal kingdom , which means the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
Although counter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the findings come as surprise because Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta 's size far exce@@ eds that of counter@@ sh@@ aded animals alive today .
It suggests the din@@ os@@ au@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure meat @@@ -@@ @ eating din@@ os@@ au@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured conc@@ e@@ al@@ ment over confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
But most contemporary animals that have counter@@ sh@@ ading -- think de@@ er , z@@ eb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as pre@@ y , sign@@ aling that this no@@ do@@ sau@@ r faced a real struggle to survive .
'@@ St@@ rong pre@@ dation on a massive , heavily @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r illustr@@ ates just how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous must have been , ' said Brown .
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its sc@@ ales also reveal that the din@@ os@@ au@@ r 's skin would have been red@@ dish brown .
Scienti@@ sts are continuing to study the animal for clu@@ es about its life , including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal .
They believe that when the din@@ os@@ au@@ r died , it fell into a river and was swe@@ pt out to sea , where it s@@ ank on its back to the ocean floor .
At that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as south Florida is today , and rivers and o@@ ce@@ ans likely spread far further in@@ land than they do now .
'@@ This no@@ do@@ sau@@ r is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved sc@@ aly skin , yet is also preserved in three dimensions , re@@ taining the original shape of the animal , ' said Brown .
'@@ The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cre@@ tac@@ eous .
You don 't need to use much imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it ; if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sleeping . ' 
The Cre@@ tac@@ eous was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , meat @@@ -@@ @ eating din@@ os@@ au@@ rs that stood on two legs , ro@@ amed the Earth .
Although the king of them all , Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus rex , lived millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r may have been hun@@ ted by some of its form@@ id@@ able anc@@ est@@ ors .
They include Acro@@ can@@ tho@@ sau@@ rus , a 38@@ ft ( 11.@@ 5m ) long mon@@ ster weigh@@ ing six tonnes .
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was wash@@ ed out to sea after it died and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mu@@ d .
The creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the Mill@@ eni@@ um M@@ ine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
According to the museum , it is the best preserved arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ au@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the sn@@ out to hi@@ ps .
The cre@@ atures were around 18 feet ( five metres ) long on average , and wei@@ ghted up to 3,@@ 000 po@@ unds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
It featured two 20 @@@ -@@ @ inch @@@ -@@ @ long spi@@ kes which prot@@ ru@@ ded from its shoul@@ ders .
The researchers believe that the this ar@@ mo@@ red plant @@@ -@@ @ e@@ ater l@@ um@@ ber@@ ed through what is now western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river swe@@ pt it into open sea .
But the din@@ os@@ au@@ r 's under@@ sea bur@@ ial preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
The fossi@@ li@@ sed remains of this particular spec@@ im@@ en are so well preserved that rem@@ n@@ ants of skin still cover b@@ um@@ p@@ y arm@@ our plates along the din@@ os@@ au@@ r 's sk@@ ull .
As Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Geo@@ graphic , such level of preservation ' is a rare as winning the lo@@ ttery .
The more I look at it , the more mind @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ gg@@ ling it becomes .
Fo@@ ssi@@ li@@ zed rem@@ n@@ ants of skin still cover the b@@ um@@ p@@ y arm@@ or plates do@@ t@@ ting the animal 's sk@@ ull .
Its right fo@@ ref@@ oo@@ t lies by its side , its five dig@@ its sp@@ la@@ yed up@@ ward .
I can count the sc@@ ales on its sole . ' 
In the stor@@ m : pi@@ le @@@ -@@ @ up on the A@@ 8 : four in@@ ju@@ red
Seri@@ ous accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : just sh@@ y of 30 vehicles were caught up in a mass col@@ li@@ sion .
There are numerous people in@@ ju@@ red , kilomet@@ re @@@ -@@ @ long qu@@ eu@@ es - and rub@@ ber@@ nec@@ kers .
On the motorway between Stuttgart and Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red late on Thursday afternoon in a mass col@@ li@@ sion .
According to initial police information , just sh@@ y of 30 vehicles , among which were probably also lor@@ ries , had cra@@ shed into each other during a stor@@ m at around 5@@ pm between the Ad@@ el@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen junc@@ tions ( in the rural district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ Fried@@ berg ) .
No information is initially available about the precise number of in@@ ju@@ red people .
There are mild to moderate inj@@ uries , said a police spo@@ kes@@ person .
There was a big squ@@ ad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident .
The A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
A roughly 10 @@@ -@@ @ km long tail@@ back formed in the direction travelling towards Munich .
As an A@@ Z journalist reports , there were massive dis@@ rup@@ tions in the opposite lan@@ e as well - due to numerous rub@@ ber@@ nec@@ kers .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted down the registration numbers of the drivers , who are now exp@@ ecting severe penalties .
Sh@@ or@@ tly after 6.@@ 45@@ pm , there was then a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
A col@@ li@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car had occurred .
A rescue he@@ licopter was under@@ way to the scene of the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Company trials " comfort check @@@ -@@ @ in "
It is a moment that practically everyone has experienced at one time or another : without exp@@ ecting it , you 're sitting in the train as@@ le@@ ep .
Or one is bur@@ ied deep in one 's work and has just had a geni@@ us idea .
And then : b@@ ang .
The conductor comes and ru@@ d@@ ely aw@@ ak@@ ens you , or te@@ ars the passenger from the midst of his work@@ flow .
Ticket inspection .
But the days of being inter@@ rupted will soon be over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently tri@@ alling conduc@@ tor@@ less ticket inspection .
One simply uses one 's mobile to confirm that one has taken one 's seat , thereby vali@@ dating the ticket .
Tri@@ al operations are currently running on two lines .
" If the service is well @@@ -@@ @ received , we 'll extend it .
It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many additional long @@@ -@@ @ distance lines across Germany , " said a spo@@ kes@@ person for the railway .
The railway is calling this conduc@@ tor@@ less ticket vali@@ dation " Comfort Check @@@ -@@ @ in . "
In order to use it , however , a few conditions must be met : you need a smart@@ phone or a tablet .
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do already any@@ way .
In addition , you have to have bought it over the Railway 's app , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case .
And la@@ stly , you need a seat reservation .
For " Comfort Check @@@ -@@ @ in " works like this : you get on board the train and call up your ticket in " My Tickets . "
The trial customers will then see a button for electronic vali@@ dation .
The train att@@ end@@ ants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is on@@ board the train and has occupied booked seat Y@@ .
If the train att@@ endant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
So you can carry on sleeping , working , doing nothing .
The " Check @@@ -@@ @ in " has two advantages : one for customers , and one for the railway - which , in turn , should benefit passengers .
" Any@@ one who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion , without having his / her ticket inspec@@ ted by our on @@@ -@@ @ train staff , simply checks in him / herself in the DB Navig@@ ator .
This allows passengers to person@@ alise their journey time in the train , " says Michael Peter@@ son , Director of Marketing at DB Fern@@ verkehr .
A second plus : " And our employees will have more time than they currently do to see to the needs of individual customers . "
Any@@ one who tra@@ vels by train a lot knows that , alongside delays and missing your train , ticket inspection is one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
For often you yourself , or , in any case , one of your fellow passengers , doesn 't have all the documentation on them that one needs to vali@@ date an online ticket .
Ei@@ ther the credit card is missing , or the ID card , or some other document that one needs to show .
The result is endless discussions between the train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to a bad atmosphere in the com@@ partment or wider area and delays in one 's own ticket getting checked , and ultimately it takes away the conductor 's time to see to other matters .
Only a small number of trial customers can use the new service as of yet .
And only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 , between Dortmund and Stuttgart , and ICE 9@@ 12 , between Stuttgart and Essen .
Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled .
How one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : ' W@@ hose Stre@@ ets ? '
On Aug@@ . 9 , 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to her core .
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip , the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b she was r@@ enting , sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
She st@@ um@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
" The police just killed an 18 year old ki@@ d and he 's still laying in the street , " it read .
Conf@@ used , notic@@ ing no one else on her feed had posted the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
A user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was being constantly ret@@ we@@ eted onto her tim@@ eline .
The St. Louis @@@ -@@ @ area ra@@ pper was live @@@ -@@ @ t@@ we@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ o .
He posted a picture of Brown 's li@@ fel@@ ess body stret@@ ched out in the street , where it would stay for four hours .
" This is wild , " Fer@@ rell thought to herself .
But death was nothing new for her and her community .
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to t@@ we@@ ets about people gathering on Can@@ field Drive .
There were photos of police tape and people y@@ elling , and of a gu@@ y claim@@ ing to be Brown 's father holding a sign that read , " F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! "
She wat@@ ched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of prote@@ sters with a bark@@ ing dog .
In another video , a different co@@ p , she said , co@@ cked his ri@@ f@@ le and scre@@ amed , " I 'll kill all you .@@ .. animals . "
" ' This is not usual , ' " Fer@@ rell recalled saying .
" ' This isn 't the type of murder that we 've become used to and can call typical . ' 
In that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was an@@ gr@@ y and cr@@ ying . "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .
After landing at 11 p.m. , she pi@@ cked up her 6 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter from her dad 's house and decided the two of them would head to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
What happened , to Fer@@ rell and to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary , " W@@ hose Stre@@ ets ? , " in the@@ aters Aug@@ . 11 .
It 's a t@@ ale of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence from the v@@ ant@@ age point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers .
As Fer@@ rell dro@@ ve to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who was we@@ aring a fl@@ oral dress and matching cro@@ wn , the two re@@ visited a conversation they 'd had countless times before that morning " about the black experience and black condition . "
" You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in ? " she recalled saying .
" We 're going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on right now because the police killed an 18 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old boy and it wasn 't right .
I couldn 't not take her , " Fer@@ rell said later .
" This happening today is a cul@@ mination of .@@ .. that has happened in the past .
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activ@@ ism and organi@@ zing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
Even if I 'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn 't personally experience b@@ lat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black woman @@@ -@@ @ child .
I feel like I would be doing her a dis@@ service to shi@@ eld her from that . "
The first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a site across from the police department that became a camp@@ ground of sor@@ ts as the activists awa@@ ited word of Officer Dar@@ ren Wil@@ son 's event@@ ual non @@@ -@@ @ indic@@ t@@ ment .
There Fer@@ rell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making s@@ ack l@@ un@@ ches .
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to prote@@ sters .
S@@ low@@ ly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
" My activ@@ ism completely transformed after Aug@@ . 9 , " she said , no@@ ting that while an under@@ grad at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @@@ -@@ @ St. Louis , she was president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Ass@@ n@@ . and focused on food justice and health disp@@ arities in black communities .
" I had no experience in organi@@ zing .
It all just came . "
Week@@ s later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film 's co @@@ -@@ @ directors , during an evening demonstration .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her director of photography Lu@@ cas Al@@ var@@ ado @@@ -@@ @ Far@@ ra@@ r " just wanted to document " what was happening .
A question came to Fer@@ rell 's mind : " Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit ? "
That skep@@ tic@@ ism was informed by countless inst@@ ances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resili@@ ence .
As Fol@@ ay@@ an explained in a recent interview , " We had heard that people who are born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not having their voices cent@@ ered , and we wanted to do it differently . "
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already linked up with co @@@ -@@ @ director Dam@@ on Dav@@ is , an area artist known for his activ@@ ism around death row in@@ m@@ ates .
His involvement ende@@ ared Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other loc@@ als the " W@@ hose Stre@@ ets ? " team followed in the years after Brown 's shooting .
" This documentary is not som@@ eb@@ ody speaking for us or speaking to us , it 's us speaking , " Dav@@ is said .
" That was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that 's how I will be represented . "
While the goal wasn 't to focus on Fer@@ rell 's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is " not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community coming together , " Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most open of the film 's participants .
As a result , " W@@ hose Stre@@ ets ? " documents surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell 's life , like falling in love and mar@@ rying her wife .
" I felt like I was n@@ aked , " said Fer@@ rell , lau@@ gh@@ ing about the first time she saw the finished product .
" But I understood that with doing this work and hum@@ ani@@ zing black fol@@ ks , there has to be a level of vulnerability . "
Moreover , Fer@@ rell 's story reiter@@ ates and re @@@ -@@ @ centers the role of black qu@@ e@@ er women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
Two of the movement 's three fo@@ unders - who co@@ ined # Black@@ Liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter on social media in the after@@ mat@@ h of the 2012 killing of black teen Tra@@ y@@ von Martin - identify as qu@@ e@@ er .
" Black qu@@ e@@ er women in leadership has sustained the movement overall , " said Fer@@ rell , " and that 's because we 're constantly at battle on multiple fron@@ ts .
Black qu@@ e@@ er women have to bear the brun@@ t of it all . "
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed no@@ ting that " the movement is really uph@@ eld by black women and a lot of qu@@ e@@ er black women . "
She insi@@ sts , however , that " this is not some affir@@ m@@ ative action type of thing " where Fer@@ rell was chosen as the film 's heart because of her identi@@ ties .
" She was the person who was gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zing this energy , " she said .
" It 's not a coinci@@ dence though she was on the front lines , because living life at those inter@@ sections as a black qu@@ e@@ er woman , you have so much on the line .
You can feel her energy through the screen . "
Meanwhile , back in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the news cameras are long gone but frau@@ ght racial ties between the community and police persi@@ st .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ more years for blo@@ cking a highway during a demonstration .
She describes the soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply : " A m@@ ess . "
Still , she cl@@ ings to a ch@@ ant she 's committed to memory since taking to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on 's streets a full three years ago .
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing to lose but our chains . "
From " dream " to " meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania " : TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie
The Bit Galerie is moving people although it is still far from being built .
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been sp@@ lit@@ ting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009 .
There is bare@@ ly anyone left in@@ different to the matter .
The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page , " Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . "
Wher@@ eas some say of the Bit Galerie , " That would be a dream " ( An@@ ja Bec@@ ker ) or , " That would be really fantastic " ( Nic@@ ole Schau@@ sten ) , from the other side we hear , " No @@@ -@@ @ one needs that " ( Si@@ gg@@ i B@@ etzen ) or , put quite bl@@ un@@ tly : " Meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! " ( Lars Sch@@ ol@@ z ) .
W@@ hil@@ st those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town , which would benefit the other businesses as well , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ aged .
In addition : The gallery is being planned for exactly the plot where the covered farmers ' market is , where 13 direct s@@ ellers offer their products .
When construction begins , that will be the end of that .
The Galerie cre@@ ators want to integrate a covered market into the new building - and , indeed , towards Bed@@ a Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : " We have been shopping almost weekly in the covered market for years now .
Princip@@ ally our eggs , but also , always with great pleasure , the delicious c@@ akes of our rural women .
We have also discovered the but@@ cher 's for ourselves .
We hope that also while the Galerie is being built , but above all after , there will be the chance to maintain this offering .
That 's what they have in other cities too .
The small covered market in Frankfurt , in particular , is interesting . "
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : " Whether direct s@@ ellers sett@@ le in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent .
But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project . "
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : " Why a shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
Whether clothing , shoes , drug stores or super@@ markets : I find it unnecessary .
There are plenty of those in our city already .
One sees , though , how many shop premises stand empty here - some for months and years .
However , since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market .
For after all , the goods on offer there are fresh , are largely offered directly by the producer , and are good value to boot .
As you see , shop premises in shopping centres are only r@@ ented by big companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not ten@@ able for retail tra@@ ders .
Sh@@ ame - there are hardly any specialist shops left any more and those that are still around will then probably also dis@@ appear . "
Wolf F@@ andel : " A shopping centre with a covered market doesn 't match up for me .
And the Galerie doesn 't suit Bit@@ burg .
In particular : Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing ?
The old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the Bit Galerie does actually arrive eventually .
Or is the spec@@ tre of the Bit Galerie managing even ahead of time to drive all businesses out of Bit@@ burg ? "
George Mar@@ quet : " It simply will not work .
And a shopping centre that stands empty - no @@@ -@@ @ one needs that either .
In my opinion , it would be better to support a proper farmers ' market , instead of this Galerie .
But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the cra@@ z@@ ily large number - as I see it - of poin@@ tless construction projects in Bit@@ burg
If the covered market is destroyed , then another piece of culture will dis@@ appear . "
A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance : artist creates portra@@ its using Chel@@ sea Mann@@ ing 's DNA
In the center of the room at New York 's Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery are multiple faces - white , black and brown , each bearing an almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance to one another - suspended on wi@@ res from the ceiling .
The 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg from che@@ ek sw@@ ab@@ s and hair cli@@ pp@@ ings sent to her by Chel@@ sea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cli@@ pp@@ ings from the Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st was serving a 35 @@@ -@@ @ year sentence after fam@@ ously le@@ aking classified diplomatic cables through the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
The new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is tit@@ led A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance .
It 's the product of two years of correspon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg , whose discipline combines her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a tran@@ s woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident whose sentence was comm@@ uted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office .
By algorith@@ m@@ ically analy@@ zing DNA extrac@@ ted from Mann@@ ing and using it to create 30 portra@@ its of what someone with that gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like , De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg has created a tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ant , if somewhat cer@@ eb@@ ral , comm@@ entary on not only the mal@@ le@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted , and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of those interpre@@ tations - but also identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born Bra@@ d@@ ley Edward but has spoken op@@ enly about identifying as a woman as early as ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , was convic@@ ted in 2013 on 20 charges , including six E@@ spi@@ on@@ age Act violations , computer fraud and the@@ ft .
From prison , her image was re@@ pressed , so much so that there was just one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing , visi@@ bly un@@ easy , si@@ ts in a driver 's seat we@@ aring a plat@@ inum bl@@ onde wig - with which she became associated .
In 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project , Stran@@ ger Vi@@ sions .
In it , the artist produced portra@@ its of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigare@@ tte but@@ ts and che@@ wing g@@ um , extrac@@ ting DNA from the det@@ rit@@ us to con@@ j@@ ure an image of what these fol@@ ks might look like .
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine .
" They were conducting an interview with Chel@@ sea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article , " De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg explained at a press pre@@ view of the new exhibition .
And she couldn 't be visited and she couldn 't be photograph@@ ed at that time , so they reached out to Chel@@ sea and asked if she 'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made .
The artist and her inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became unlikely pen p@@ als , ex@@ changing several letters over the course of two years .
They even created a com@@ ic book , Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , illustr@@ ated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , that en@@ vi@@ sion@@ ed a future where the president would comm@@ ute Chel@@ sea 's sentence and she 'd be able to see the exhibition in person .
That Obama would indeed call for Mann@@ ing 's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity after seven brutal years at a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as .
There 's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now , as Donald Trump wages war on government le@@ ak@@ ers and trans@@ gender troops while finding new , t@@ we@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the stark divisions he 's been called on to m@@ end .
When asked about the p@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar tim@@ ing of it all , De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg said that " things happen for a reason . "
In an artist statement written on the gallery 's wall , Mann@@ ing 's super @@@ -@@ @ sized signature below it ( the " i " in her last name do@@ tted with a heart ) , called for an end to the " automatic fac@@ tion@@ alism that gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture have been the basis of . "
On the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de of Cs and Gs and As , written in pen@@ cil .
By including the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ des , per the artist 's sophisticated scientific lex@@ icon ) , De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg hoped to illustr@@ ate how ast@@ o@@ und@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , we all are .
" What I 'm hop@@ ing that people will take away from this is that our gen@@ ome doesn 't care about who we are , and how open genetic data is to interpretation , how subjec@@ tive it is , " said De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg , whose 2007 video work , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also on display .
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so this is 30 of those stories . "
The final piece in the exhibition , which is contained in a single room , is one page from the af@@ ore@@ mentioned graphic nov@@ ella .
It shows Mann@@ ing , emerging , King Kong @@@ -@@ @ es@@ que , from the United States Di@@ si@@ pl@@ inary Bar@@ ra@@ cks with a speak@@ er@@ phone in hand .
" When they ch@@ ill your speech , then they 've won , " it reads .
" So never sh@@ ut up . "
" It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , " the artist , who ha@@ ils from Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a , said .
" I get goo@@ seb@@ um@@ ps still talking about it . "
Mann@@ ing has@@ n 't seen the exhibition in @@@ -@@ @ person yet - as was so pres@@ ci@@ ently imag@@ ined in the com@@ ic book - but when she does , she 'll be gre@@ eted in the center of the room by the m@@ asks , her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ra con@@ greg@@ ated like hor@@ des of prote@@ sters .
That was pur@@ po@@ se@@ ful , too , as is everything in the exhibition , down to the height ( 5 " 2 , Mann@@ ing 's stat@@ ure ) at which her genetic ha@@ plo@@ groups were written in pen@@ cil .
" In the past , I 've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crow@@ d , " De@@ we@@ y @@@ -@@ @ H@@ ag@@ borg said of the portra@@ its .
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chel@@ sea , like the movement that was behind fre@@ eing her as well . "
Nor@@ th@@ western Professor and Oxford University Emplo@@ ye@@ e Wan@@ ted for Hom@@ ici@@ de
A nation@@ wide man@@ hun@@ t is under@@ way for a Nor@@ th@@ western University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as susp@@ ects after a man was found fat@@ ally stab@@ bed inside a luxury Chicago apartment , police said .
On Monday , first @@@ -@@ @ degree murder warran@@ ts without b@@ ail were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them , 42 , and Andrew War@@ ren , 56 , for their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @@@ -@@ @ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , C@@ ook County court records show .
The documents say Corn@@ ell @@@ -@@ @ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after being stab@@ bed multiple times .
A community al@@ ert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27 .
Offic@@ ers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lac@@ er@@ ations on his body .
Corn@@ ell @@@ -@@ @ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was pron@@ ounc@@ ed dead on the scene and det@@ ec@@ tives are investig@@ ating the stab@@ bing as a hom@@ ici@@ de while police actively search for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associ@@ ate professor of micro@@ biology and imm@@ un@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , the vice president for university relations , said in an em@@ ail@@ ed statement that La@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Nor@@ th@@ western University camp@@ uses .
" This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University is co@@ operating in that investigation , " Cub@@ b@@ age said .
War@@ ren is a senior treas@@ ury assistant at Oxford University .
A spo@@ kes@@ person for the university and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an em@@ ail@@ ed statement that , " We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ating authorities in any way they need . "
The statement added that War@@ ren 's colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to turn himself in .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encourages the susp@@ ects to sur@@ render to authorities .
" Police have an idea of their wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs but our efforts to locate that are intensi@@ fying , " Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryp@@ tic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 10@@ 08 .
Police described the scene as very gru@@ es@@ ome .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear if the incident also occurred on July 27 .
La@@ them and War@@ ren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras , he said .
" We believe Professor La@@ th@@ am and the victim had a relationship , " Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying , " Police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of mo@@ tives , including a possible domestic incident . "
" We 'll complete W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in near future " - Russian Deputy PM Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) criteria for the rein@@ statement of the Russian Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
" A certain stage of ful@@ filling the road map criteria has been carried out , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing ) .
The W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map was updated in this regard , " Mut@@ ko stated on Thursday .
The PM was comm@@ enting on the second part of W@@ AD@@ A 's Road@@ map to Code Comp@@ liance , which describes the criteria for the rein@@ statement of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and which recently published on the organization 's website .
According to Mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
" Everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [ IO@@ C ] and W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , " he added .
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti @@@ -@@ @ d@@ op@@ ing authorities must public@@ ally accept the reported out@@ comes of the W@@ AD@@ A @@@ -@@ @ sanc@@ tioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @@@ -@@ @ sponsored d@@ op@@ ing in Russian sport .
Refer@@ ring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : " We are conducting the investigation , as our anti @@@ -@@ @ d@@ op@@ ing system admitted a failure .
All measures have been implemented .
But there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that didn 't exist . "
Mut@@ ko 's words echo@@ ed those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of Russia 's Independent Public Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing Commission .
Tal@@ king to Russian out@@ let R@@ Sport earlier in the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v admitted past problems in Russian anti @@@ -@@ @ d@@ op@@ ing bodies , but added : " We have said on numerous occasions , that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
No one plans to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , " Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was suspended from carrying out d@@ op@@ ing controls within Russia by W@@ AD@@ A in November 2015 in the wake of the d@@ op@@ ing sc@@ andal .
It was , however , permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Ant@@ i @@@ -@@ @ D@@ op@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) this June .
Following a visit to the organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A Director General Oli@@ vier Ni@@ g@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A is " moving in the right direction " to be re@@ inst@@ ated .
Al@@ di is selling no more eggs for the time being
This was announced by the corporate group .
It is a purely precau@@ tionary measure , and beyond that , no adverse effects on health can be assumed , said the announcement .
With immediate effect , only eggs that have been proven to test neg@@ atively for fi@@ pron@@ il @@@ -@@ @ containing anti @@@ -@@ @ li@@ ce agent may be delivered to Al@@ di .
With the move , Al@@ di wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers .
The start @@@ -@@ @ ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ ber
Am@@ y Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to g@@ au@@ ge employee happ@@ iness at her e @@@ -@@ @ commerce start @@@ -@@ @ up , but surve@@ ys weren 't working .
Respon@@ ses were often v@@ ague , un@@ helpful or , worse , dec@@ eit@@ ful .
And even if she promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn 't trust the process .
" It just never had consistency and objec@@ tivity , " said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @@@ -@@ @ person San Francisco e @@@ -@@ @ commerce hair care company Ma@@ dis@@ on Re@@ ed .
So she called in out@@ si@@ ders for help .
A new bre@@ ed of human resources start @@@ -@@ @ ups is c@@ rop@@ ping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , they allow companies to do sn@@ ap p@@ olls , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ wers to b@@ yp@@ ass C @@@ -@@ @ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and go straight to the board of directors .
" You 've now got tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where 's the Fit@@ bit for your company ? " said J@@ im Bar@@ net@@ t , co @@@ -@@ @ founder and chief executive of Red@@ wood City start @@@ -@@ @ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ re@@ tt said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using G@@ lin@@ t .
In addition to the sn@@ ap surve@@ ys and p@@ olls of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to dri@@ ll down on why .
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture , l@@ est they become the next U@@ ber , which has been en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in sc@@ andal since a former employee published a blog post descri@@ bing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who spoke out were pun@@ ished .
For start @@@ -@@ @ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for o@@ versi@@ ght is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
The global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to finance tech insi@@ ghts website Let 's Tal@@ k Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Col@@ o . , start @@@ -@@ @ up Conver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an up@@ tick in interest and activity earlier this year am@@ id U@@ ber 's fall into dis@@ rep@@ ute .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft , and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
Like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent lets companies send customized " pul@@ se " surve@@ ys , gather confidential responses in real time , and view heat maps of its problem areas .
It also offers an an@@ onymous tex@@ ting hot@@ line that lets employees report bad behavior .
And if the chief executive is imp@@ lic@@ ated , complaints go straight to the board of directors .
" The court of public opinion has us@@ ur@@ ped regulators , " said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and chief executive of Conver@@ cent .
If a company is found to treat its employees po@@ or@@ ly or be@@ have un@@ eth@@ ically , even if regulators don 't step in , it can face co@@ stly consequences from consumer bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ ts , employee attri@@ tion and law@@ su@@ its , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees across 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters .
Pre@@ viously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters , lo@@ dge a formal complaint , and hope it was taken seriously .
It was often an in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tuesday 's general coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints .
Now that the company is using Conver@@ cent , though , problems that were previously hidden from exec@@ u@@ tives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed .
" I can get closer to that holi@@ stic , 360 @@@ -@@ @ degree view into the employment experience , " said Vit@@ rano , who over@@ sees Ru@@ by Tuesday 's risk management group .
" And we 're protecting our shareholders from employment li@@ tig@@ ation . "
Companies started taking eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations from the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
But it wasn 't until " social media came into its own " that companies realized they couldn 't stop their dir@@ ty laundry from going vi@@ ral online .
" Pri@@ or to using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .
Both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , charging companies rec@@ ur@@ ring fees to use their products .
It 's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have pro@@ pped up both start @@@ -@@ @ ups .
Conver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as S@@ app@@ hire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 47 million .
G@@ lin@@ t secured $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
There 's a growing body of research showing today 's employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
In competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are merely table stak@@ es .
Emplo@@ ye@@ es want to feel that they 're accepted and valu@@ ed and that they 're giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
" When people are happy to be at a company , feel their voices are heard , and that the work they are doing is re@@ war@@ ding , they are more committed to making that company successful , " said N@@ ina Mc@@ Queen , vice president of global benefits and employee experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
Invest@@ ors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged .
If third @@@ -@@ @ party analy@@ tics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement , it 's no wonder they 're finding backing .
Having data on employee engagement is important , according to workplace culture experts .
But the data are us@@ eless unless a company 's cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans take action .
In fact , if a company asks employees for their feedback , it can set an expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
And if change doesn 't come fast enough , or at all , it can bre@@ ed dis@@ appointment and make employees di@@ sen@@ g@@ aged .
" If you 're going to ask for 4,@@ 000 suggestions , you need to be prepared to have 4,@@ 000 convers@@ ations , " said R@@ ussel@@ l Ra@@ ath , president of consulting at business management firm Ko@@ tter International , who has seen companies make the mistake of rel@@ ying too much on data collection .
" Because if you don 't follow through , employees will wonder , ' Di@@ d you really hear me ?
Do you care ?
And if you don 't care , why should I care ? ' "
Ma@@ dis@@ on Re@@ ed , which now does monthly employee surve@@ ys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , according to Er@@ re@@ tt .
And , after gathering feedback from employees fru@@ str@@ ated by the speed of decision @@@ -@@ @ making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
Over at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is getting new insight on its employees , and it 's hop@@ ing that in the long run , this will convert to better re@@ tention of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
" If you 're not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you 're going to lose people , " Vit@@ rano said .
" And if you lose people , you 're going to lose customers .
And when you lose customers , you 're going to lose companies . "
The N@@ CA@@ A 's elimination of two @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ day practices makes for a long day for the Bru@@ ins
It 's push@@ ing 11 p.m. as a th@@ rong of UC@@ LA football players ling@@ er to chat on one side of the team 's new on @@@ -@@ @ camp@@ us practice fields .
Some have pe@@ eled off their jer@@ sey tops , reve@@ aling backs s@@ lick with swe@@ at from the to@@ il of the first day of training camp .
For a good ch@@ unk of the team , these i@@ dle minutes constitute a mid@@ day break .
Players en@@ rolled in summer classes will head back to their dor@@ ms after the three @@@ -@@ @ hour practice to study for final exam@@ s before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center for meetings at 6 : 30 the following morning .
" This is a grin@@ d for these gu@@ ys the next three days , " Bru@@ ins coach J@@ im Mor@@ a said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday .
The N@@ CA@@ A 's elimination of two @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ day practices , designed to ligh@@ ten the load on players , has actually leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until fin@@ als end Friday .
That 's why UC@@ LA 's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to accommodate players ' already cra@@ mm@@ ed sched@@ ules .
The trade @@@ -@@ @ off from no two @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ days is more one @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ days , the Bru@@ ins push@@ ing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a 's six seas@@ ons in West@@ wood .
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug@@ . 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their op@@ ener against Texas A & M on S@@ ept .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A 's rule change even if it did add another item to players ' busy it@@ iner@@ aries .
" We 're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it 's very challenging , " Mor@@ a said .
" And they 've just push@@ ed through it ; they grin@@ d , they 're great kids .
I think once we get to Saturday and we 'll have more time , it will really be great . "
UC@@ LA will close its practices once camp is finished , no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the ad@@ joining L@@ us@@ kin Center , an up@@ scale hotel that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ balls that cle@@ ared a protective net behind a go@@ al@@ post .
Bru@@ ins players are scheduled to occup@@ y the hotel beginning this weekend , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vac@@ ant during the season .
" We will have security , " Mor@@ a said .
" That is a real concern and it 's not far @@@ -@@ @ f@@ et@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e a practice .
If you have vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e of a practice , it 's a pretty good deal .
But we 'll have security there and we 'll have security up in Parking Lot 8 .
We 'll do the best we can with what we got .
I 'm not going to worry too much about it .
We have a plan in place . "
Facebook to step up fact @@@ -@@ @ checking in fight against f@@ ake news
Facebook is to send more potential ho@@ ax articles to third @@@ -@@ @ party fact check@@ ers and show their findings below the original post , the world 's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so @@@ -@@ @ called f@@ ake news .
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible ho@@ ax@@ es and send them to fact check@@ ers , potentially showing fact @@@ -@@ @ checking results under the original article .
Facebook has been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed as being one of the main distribution points for so @@@ -@@ @ called f@@ ake news , which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe , with French voters del@@ u@@ ged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hat@@ e@@ ful post@@ ings promp@@ tly , ahead of elections there in September .
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact @@@ -@@ @ checking feature was being launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
" In addition to seeing which stories are disp@@ uted by third @@@ -@@ @ party fact check@@ ers , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said S@@ ara S@@ u , Facebook news feed product manager , in a blog .
She added that Facebook would keep testing its " related article " feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news .
Building a graphic novel : A Castle in England 's story
In its recent past , the dimin@@ utive Scot@@ ney Castle has featured in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and been a bol@@ th@@ ole for Margare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher during the 197@@ 0s and 1980s .
But Scot@@ ney has witness@@ ed 700 years of tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous history from its cosy seat in Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent , now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jam@@ ie Rho@@ des , a mo@@ p @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pen@@ ch@@ ant for historical documents .
" I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says wi@@ st@@ fully .
" What a personal connection , to hold that letter in my hand . "
Spann@@ ing the middle ages to the Ed@@ war@@ dian era , A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney , with each story illustr@@ ated by a different , upcoming UK artist - Isa@@ ac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
It is not Rho@@ des 's first book based on an archive : he also wrote 2014 's De@@ ad Men 's Te@@ eth and Other St@@ ories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expec@@ tedly emotional .
" I well@@ ed up at just the thumb@@ print on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 17@@ 00@@ s who was working for the Jac@@ ob@@ ites , " he says .
" That 's his thumb@@ print !
And letters always sm@@ ell like smoke because , back then , you lit a fire for light .
To someone 300 years in the future , the sm@@ ell makes it feel like they 're there , too .
Ah , I love archives ! "
For someone so s@@ mitten with old papers , getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ( " I over@@ stayed my welcome a little bit , to be honest " ) seems too good to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian " new " castle , going through the archives and studying the man@@ or 's many treas@@ ures and curi@@ os , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bott@@ les that had spent centuries in the mo@@ at .
He wander@@ ed the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , talking to ran@@ gers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes the artists at work on his book 's illustrations .
Then at night , he 'd " drink wh@@ is@@ key and get writing . "
The intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final h@@ eir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
When Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , staff were only starting to tackle the archive , which he describes as " hundreds of years of ari@@ sto@@ crats going : ' O@@ h , stick it in the lo@@ ft ' . "
Di@@ aries , letters from the days of the English emp@@ ire , maps out@@ lining who owned what : " You 'd think land disputes would be bor@@ ing , " says Rho@@ des , " but there was this one bir@@ ch tree two families were fighting over .
Just let it go , gu@@ ys ! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jum@@ ping @@@ -@@ @ off point to del@@ ve more broadly into English history , including The Lab@@ our@@ er , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 13@@ 81 Pe@@ as@@ ants ' Re@@ vol@@ t .
" There is a record of a ri@@ ot happening at the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book called the Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , " says Rho@@ des .
" The Pe@@ as@@ ants ' Re@@ vol@@ t started in that area and I thought , a ri@@ ot is a good place to start .
May@@ be the two are connected ? "
Other stories are roo@@ ted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Pri@@ est , which tells the t@@ ale of the Jes@@ u@@ it priest whom the Dar@@ rell family hi@@ d for seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
Or The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler , which features 18th @@@ -@@ @ century contra@@ ban@@ der Arthur Dar@@ rell , who is thought to have st@@ aged his own f@@ uner@@ al by filling a coff@@ in with rocks ( a discovery made years later when his coff@@ in was un@@ earth@@ ed ) .
The Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des 's favourite Scot@@ ney family : " The gentlemen seemed to be quite ro@@ gu@@ ish , always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn 't afford .
Differ@@ ent generations of Dar@@ rell men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a b@@ unch of hand@@ some gu@@ ys , with a kn@@ ack for woo@@ ing hei@@ res@@ ses . "
With his assign@@ ment in the castle over , Rho@@ des is on the hun@@ t for other sing@@ ular writing experiences .
He has completed a two @@@ -@@ @ week st@@ int in the Finnish wil@@ der@@ ness for a graphic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of an early 20th @@@ -@@ @ century san@@ atorium that has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
But Scot@@ ney holds a special place for him .
" I was sad to leave , " he says .
" It was like : ' Ah , I 've got to go deal with fu@@ cking real life now . ' "
Camp@@ ai@@ gn launched : over 300 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Lady Chap@@ el in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf enc@@ ased
By enc@@ asing the 301 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Lady Chap@@ el in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched their campaign to introduce a new umbre@@ lla brand ( Thursday 's Rund@@ schau ) .
Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team , led by N@@ elson Ar@@ tz , want to keep the logo and s@@ logan a secret still , until Thursday .
At the end of August , as the cli@@ max of the campaign , there is to be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
" To@@ o beautiful for us ,
are you ? " The campaign authors have been asking this , on po@@ sters on the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chap@@ el , since yesterday .
" We don 't really think that ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website , activated yesterday .
" But we are using this initiative to get your attention .
And to bring home that some things are better than they seem .
In actual fact , we are firmly convinced that we , as residents of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f , are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our town . "
The initiative is about more than " just " a logo and a s@@ logan , it continues .
" A stand @@@ -@@ @ alone ple@@ dge has to be form@@ ulated , one that l@@ ends the town an un@@ mistak@@ able unique selling point . "
Ul@@ timately , it is in competition with other municipalities .
The town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has given itself a moderate five @@@ -@@ @ figure amount for the costs of its new umbre@@ lla brand and the campaign .
Military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan 's fear of the army
Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August , the highest military council ( Y@@ AS ) adv@@ ises on reti@@ re@@ ments and promo@@ tions in the officer cor@@ ps .
So too this week .
At first glance , a normal procedure .
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the cou@@ p attempt .
The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously , but rather in the Prime Minister 's official residence .
Tak@@ ing part in the discussions ch@@ aired by the head of government were now also the five vice premi@@ ers , as well as the ministers for defence , the interior , justice , and foreign affairs .
The civilians were thus in the majority in the Y@@ AS .
The government is tigh@@ tening the re@@ ins on the military .
Chief of Staff H@@ ul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , the air force and the mar@@ ines were removed .
Since the failed cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fi@@ red 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
Over 10@@ ,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of ex@@ iled pre@@ acher F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , whom Erdo@@ gan sees as the master@@ mind behind the cou@@ p attempt .
As of this week in Ankara , trials are being held against 48@@ 6 people who are said to have been directly involved in the cou@@ p attempt .
Already on the day after the cou@@ p , Erdo@@ gan described the attempt at over@@ throw as a " gift from God , " since it gives him the opportunity to " completely clean@@ se " the armed forces .
But does Erdo@@ gan really have control over the army ?
At the end of February , the newspaper " H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet " published an article with the head@@ line " U@@ ne@@ ase in the military headquarters . "
There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing " Islam@@ isation " of the army , which manifest@@ s itself , among other ways , in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper .
The big clean @@@ -@@ @ up of the army and the security forces is continuing any@@ way .
In the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan fi@@ red , by decre@@ e , an additional 7@@ 3@@ 95 public serv@@ ants , among whom were 230@@ 3 polic@@ eman and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
In doing so , it seems as if Erdo@@ gan has t@@ amed the military .
Pre@@ viously , the gener@@ als were deemed the true authorities in the country .
Three times they st@@ aged a cou@@ p , invo@@ king their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state order .
After an election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan has been push@@ ing back the strength of the military bit by bit , not least by invo@@ king the reform guidelines of the European Union .
Former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pur@@ po@@ se@@ fully promoting Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
In the magazine " Vo@@ cal Europe , " an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum abroad after the attemp@@ ted cou@@ p out of fear of persecution , war@@ ned that the Turkish army would be " full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists " in a few years .
If that is true , Nat@@ o would not be able to be in@@ different to such a development .
In any case , after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army 's read@@ iness for action .
The governance structures and operational capabilities are " weak@@ ened , " say Nat@@ o diplom@@ ats .
Washington Chan@@ ges the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules , President Donald Trump said , quo@@ ted by the media .
It envis@@ ages reducing legal immigrants to 50@@ ,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining temporary work vis@@ as and restrictions on family @@@ -@@ @ oriented vis@@ as .
The new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and are supported by the president .
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two cham@@ bers of Congress .
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billi@@ ons of dollars for taxpayers , and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Car@@ ds to citizens from other countries .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme .
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English , have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quo@@ ted by the American media .
Minister wants line renovated for Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle
In recent months , there have been constant arguments about the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle - now it is said to be moving very quickly .
There are plans to build on the di@@ la@@ pi@@ dated stret@@ ch of track , on which the tourist trains travel , before the end of the year still .
In order to ensure the long @@@ -@@ @ term future of the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle , construction works should begin on the line this year already , according to reports from the Ministry of Transport .
" In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renov@@ ate the Il@@ m@@ n@@ au @@@ -@@ @ Renn@@ stei@@ g line , the state acknowled@@ ges that this is an important connection , above all for tourism , " stated Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
He estimated the costs for the rep@@ airs to the line to be around 2.5 million euros .
The state is taking on 75 per cent of this amount .
The contract , on the basis of which , the shuttle is to be commissioned by the state in the future as well , is currently being fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
The mini@@ stry and Süd @@@ -@@ @ Th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn , as operators , are said to already be in agreement over the technical details .
" The timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated , " said S@@ üh@@ l .
The planned contract between the mini@@ stry and the train company is being concluded for a period of el@@ even years .
The Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017 .
The Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , bel@@ o@@ ved above all by tourists .
In past months , as part of a pilot operation , there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future .
The line is very run @@@ -@@ @ down in places .
The rise of sex ro@@ bots is real , and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn 't get any wei@@ r@@ der along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector .
Y@@ ep .
Sex ro@@ bots are a big deal right now .
Rec@@ ently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) released a report looking at the development of sex ro@@ bots over the next five to 10 years .
According to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ it@@ us professor of ro@@ bo@@ tics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sh@@ eff@@ ield and co @@@ -@@ @ founder of the FR@@ R , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
Custom@@ ers can choose the robot 's eye colour , ni@@ pp@@ le shape and f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail type .
" People s@@ ni@@ gger about them , but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more , " Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey said at the launch of the new report .
Modern sex d@@ olls have evol@@ ved out of their b@@ low @@@ -@@ @ up counter@@ parts into ro@@ bots with a si@@ licon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliber@@ ately human @@@ -@@ @ like responses achieved by artificial intelligence .
The user can also " custom@@ ise " their robot to suit their persu@@ a@@ sions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye colour , ni@@ pp@@ le shape to f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail type or colour .
But it gets even more distur@@ bing , with many of the ro@@ bots poss@@ essing " person@@ alities " that would make a Ste@@ p@@ ford Wi@@ fe look progressive .
Modern sex d@@ olls have evol@@ ved into ro@@ bots with a si@@ licon skin .
The Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows users to custom@@ ise their ro@@ bots according to the tra@@ its they find appe@@ aling , such as sh@@ yn@@ ess .
Then there are the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold sex ro@@ bots , developed by True Compani@@ on , which come with p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ program@@ med person@@ alities , including " Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ ra@@ h " that gives the impression of sh@@ yn@@ ess and " Wild W@@ endy " with an " adv@@ entu@@ rous " personality .
" Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality which is mat@@ ched as much as possible to your personality , " the True Compani@@ on website enth@@ uses .
So she li@@ kes what you like , dis@@ li@@ kes what you dis@@ like , etc .
She also has mo@@ o@@ ds during the day just like real people !
She can be sle@@ ep@@ y , convers@@ ational or she can ' be in the mood ' ! "
There are many distur@@ bing aspects to the rise of sex ro@@ bots - not least of which is the replacement of real , human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female tra@@ its , the rap@@ ey con@@ no@@ tations of making a move on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( read : resistant ) Far@@ ra@@ h , are the most concerning .
On its website , True Compani@@ on lik@@ ened Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy to a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
" If woman ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can 't men have a Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? " the website states .
However , these sex ro@@ bots are not a mere fetish or just another sex to@@ y .
Their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation points to something dark@@ er and deeper within our culture , a re@@ treat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional add @@@ -@@ @ on .
Most men , naturally , are not going to keep sex ro@@ bots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popul@@ arity , they remain , for now , on the ou@@ ts@@ kir@@ ts of consumer culture .
But what se@@ eps in from the f@@ ring@@ es can be highly instruc@@ tive as to the ten@@ or of the era we 're living in .
And many people aren 't wei@@ rd or offen@@ sive until the free market gives them the permission to be so .
There is little coinci@@ dence that these sophisticated sex ro@@ bots have emerged at a time when women 's rights are under threat across the globe , when there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ gged about sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ting women .
The most ch@@ illing aspect of the TV series The Hand@@ ma@@ id 's T@@ ale isn 't the graphic imag@@ ery , the no@@ o@@ sed bodies and g@@ ou@@ ged eyes , but just how realistic that vision feels .
The Republic of Gil@@ ead is a lea@@ p , but , right now , it doesn 't feel like a large one .
The aim behind these sex ro@@ bots is to create as much of a physical lik@@ eness to actual women ( alb@@ eit with porn star propor@@ tions ) as technologi@@ cally possible .
Their cre@@ ators want them to feel human to the touch , for them to m@@ im@@ ic the movement of a real body .
But , poin@@ tedly , when it comes to their " person@@ alities " the ro@@ bots do not represent real women .
They cannot break up with their compani@@ on , or walk out .
They have no agency or back @@@ -@@ @ story , nothing to suggest independence or anything that may dis@@ rupt the fant@@ asy of total serv@@ it@@ ude .
They are pleasant sla@@ ves , in other words .
Or to put it into 2017 par@@ l@@ ance : hand@@ ma@@ i@@ dens .
Trump 's great fe@@ at ?
Mak@@ ing Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney seem the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
It has become a tru@@ ism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ ar@@ ised the US elec@@ torate have , on a micro @@@ -@@ @ scale , tor@@ n families apart .
Around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , newspapers in the US abo@@ und@@ ed with advice columns on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Trump @@@ -@@ @ voting rel@@ atives .
We are all sup@@ pos@@ edly stra@@ ining to bur@@ st our filter bub@@ bles .
L@@ ess re@@ marked on is the power of Trump to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ in , a left @@@ -@@ @ le@@ an@@ ing po@@ et who lives in Chicago and who 's long been at log@@ ger@@ heads with Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , has been visiting me in New York this week .
She remin@@ ded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republi@@ can si@@ bling she had been bi@@ ck@@ ering with about politics for decades , is suddenly and p@@ ec@@ uli@@ arly on the same side .
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing ; but it stri@@ kes me that , in a broader context , it carries significant risks .
The left has been in@@ vigor@@ ated by Trump , but the war@@ ping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all ri@@ ght@@ wards .
When we talk about " normali@@ sation " and Trump , we are referring to the sc@@ ary possibility that his an@@ tics may one day ce@@ ase to app@@ al .
There is an even sc@@ ari@@ er long @@@ -@@ @ range scenario , however , in which what Trump " normali@@ ses " are righ@@ tw@@ ing Re@@ public@@ ans who , held up against his standards , suddenly seem the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself actively no@@ stal@@ gic these days for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney 's qu@@ ain@@ t version of cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both of which , compared to Trump , seem very mild off@@ ences indeed .
When Trump goes , the next Republi@@ can candidate will merely have to be s@@ ane to quali@@ fy as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
While my c@@ ous@@ in was in town , we took our kids to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sel@@ s run by the New York parks department , and the best three bu@@ cks you can spend in the city if you don 't require c@@ aff@@ eine .
The horses are th@@ under@@ ously huge , the fibre @@@ -@@ @ glass designs on the central cylinder - all gur@@ ning c@@ low@@ ns and animals twi@@ sting to look over their own shoul@@ ders in terror - ut@@ terly sin@@ i@@ ster , and the tin@@ kl@@ ing music od@@ dly transpor@@ ting .
So many of the c@@ liches of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : views from t@@ all buildings get old , sk@@ y@@ lines grow too familiar to offer much of a thri@@ ll , and the reality of the city doesn 't live up to the dream .
Thir@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years later and I 'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cott@@ age is not , in fact , a Swiss cottage - the theme pu@@ b , Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cott@@ age , doesn 't count - but a large round@@ about in north London .
The Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel , however , is still a wei@@ r@@ dly mag@@ ical experience , to the extent that two two @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds , an 11 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old and two women in their 40@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
If I could have rated the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given it full marks , but th@@ ank@@ fully nobody asked .
In a department store this week , on the other hand , I was required , before swi@@ ping my credit card , to rate my trans@@ ac@@ tional " experience " on a scale of one to five stars .
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it 's the same thing , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this for buying something over the counter .
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but to put pressure on the server to in@@ ject personality into a situation where none is required .
The poor woman in the department store stood gr@@ inning ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically while , we@@ arily , I gave the experience of hand@@ ing her my credit card five stars .
Osc@@ ar Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us taken from j@@ ail to hospital with ch@@ est pain@@ s
This is the second time Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us has left j@@ ail for a hospital visit .
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell .
Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by prosec@@ ut@@ ors against an initial man@@ slau@@ ghter ver@@ dict .
He killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Val@@ ent@@ ine 's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet c@@ ub@@ ic@@ le door at his Pre@@ t@@ oria home .
Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us claimed he mi@@ st@@ ook his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night@@ time in@@ tru@@ der hi@@ ding in the c@@ ub@@ ic@@ le .
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal again , this time against Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us ' six @@@ -@@ @ year sentence , which they say is too l@@ eni@@ ent .
The National Pro@@ sec@@ uting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa 's Supreme Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pi@@ st@@ ori@@ us faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
There is no death penalty in South Africa .
When far@@ mer Arnold found a curi@@ ous egg
As the last amongst the schools in Bl@@ um@@ berg , the fourth gra@@ ders from Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were let go for the holidays and sent forth for secondary schools .
Three of the gradu@@ ating students will be going to the G@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um secondary school , and four to the Real@@ schule .
School head@@ teacher Ange@@ lika Sit@@ te gre@@ eted parents and public representatives in the Bi@@ es@@ ental community centre in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
As a symbol for the school gradu@@ ation , the 29 students from the fourth grade , under the leadership of Sop@@ hia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose an e@@ ag@@ le that is growing up in the chi@@ cken yard , but will be then released into the wild .
Added to this , the lively b@@ unch performed a musical with the title " The E@@ ag@@ le in the Chi@@ cken Y@@ ard . "
Far@@ mer Arnold found a curi@@ ous egg and had his chi@@ ck@@ ens hat@@ ch it .
Instead of a ch@@ ick , a small e@@ ag@@ le emerged .
Yet hopes of making a chi@@ cken out of it were d@@ ash@@ ed ; the e@@ ag@@ le spread its wings out on a high mountain and van@@ ished .
After@@ wards , gra@@ des three and four performed a chi@@ cken dance , st@@ aged by Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
The h@@ ens dan@@ ced in competition with the young roo@@ sters , who were we@@ aring top hat@@ s .
The e@@ ag@@ le stands for integration , said head@@ teacher Ange@@ lika Sit@@ te .
The young animals may well be different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs amongst them .
Th@@ ough it will never be like a chi@@ cken .
It is its dest@@ iny to be free .
She wish@@ ed for every fourth gra@@ der that he / she would feel accepted in his / her new school .
There followed a word of thanks to her colleagues , the former head@@ teacher Michael Müller , who is always filling in when there are teacher short@@ ages , and the parent representatives .
The time as chi@@ cks is now over , explained class teacher Sop@@ hia Schu@@ macher .
She releases her students only very re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ antly , after two years of teaching , for it has been a really fantastic time .
In the end , she was able to depend on the fourth gra@@ ders .
To close , all the students raised a song , with Sum@@ mer@@ time and Holiday Time .
That brought out a lot of joy from the children .
There are already eight first gra@@ ders registered for the new school year .
Two Bulg@@ arians W@@ ere Det@@ ain@@ ed For Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
Two Bulg@@ arians were detain@@ ed for illegal camping in Greece , the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced , quo@@ ted by b@@ TV .
A group of illeg@@ ally camping people , including the two Bulg@@ arians , was detain@@ ed by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia in the morning of August 1 .
The same day they were released , while an investigation is currently under@@ way .
The mini@@ stry of foreign affairs reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
The Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught re@@ sting in a place not intended for the purpose .
Ch@@ ecks will continue throughout the season .
The mini@@ stry said that the court may impose a fine .
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected now need to know
How exactly is the software update taking place ?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative ?
The most important questions and answers at a glance .
At the Diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total .
They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars class@@ ed under Euro emissions standard 5 , and , some under Euro 6 .
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment :
Is the new initiative compulsory ?
No , the bro@@ k@@ ered software updates are voluntary .
" The compulsory updates prior to this apply only to vehicles that have emissions test sc@@ amm@@ ing software , " says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
The Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) has ordered that they be retro@@ fitted .
How and from when are customers being notified of updates ?
The manufacturers have announced that there will be swi@@ ft implementation in the coming months , but have not specified any precise deadline yet .
Daim@@ ler has advised those affected to write to them .
If an inspection is due any@@ way , this will be settled during the course of that .
How long are the retro@@ f@@ itt@@ ings likely to dra@@ g on for al@@ together ?
" Diff@@ icul@@ t to say , " says S@@ met@@ at@@ n@@ in .
It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure .
" For we have seen that thus far , car manufacturers have not been acting of their own acc@@ ord when it comes to matters of the environment . "
How long should the update last ?
The retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage .
It could be more lab@@ orious getting an appointment .
What do car drivers do who don 't drive a car by BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel or the VW Group ?
The ACE adv@@ ises waiting .
Foreign manufacturers would apparently follow suit , said S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars ?
The ACE fears that .
But just in those regions where there are threats of driving b@@ ans .
In rural areas , there have as yet been no drop@@ s in value for older diesel cars .
The ACE adv@@ ises still waiting before selling .
L@@ L C@@ ool J receives Ken@@ ne@@ dy Center hon@@ ours
The Ken@@ ne@@ dy Awards Gal@@ a is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
The first hon@@ ours ceremony under President Trump promises to get political .
One of the award winners does not want to come - out of protest .
L@@ L C@@ ool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the co@@ v@@ eted awards of the renowned Ken@@ ne@@ dy Center .
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , sin@@ gers Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) and Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as cho@@ reo@@ graph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ la@@ de ( 86 ) and the TV producer Nor@@ man Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are also among those being hon@@ oured .
The awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
As is tradition , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and will take part in the presentation of awards , together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
For this reason , the award @@@ -@@ @ winner Le@@ ar , made famous by a series of TV shows , already announced that he would not be att@@ ending the gal@@ a .
He said to the " New York Times " : " This presidency has decided to completely turn its back on the arts and human rights - even take funding away from them - and that up@@ sets me . "
The 59 @@@ -@@ @ year old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear .
The Ken@@ ne@@ dy Center , named after former president John F. Ken@@ ne@@ dy , is the biggest cultural establishment in the US capital .
Former pri@@ ze@@ winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Frank@@ lin , Robert De N@@ ir@@ o , George Lu@@ cas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
We 're making the city li@@ ve@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , municipal architect in Has@@ lach , is going into retirement next year .
The post has already been adverti@@ sed - suitable applicants , though , are few and far between .
W@@ acker has been municipal architect for 31 years .
And he still finds the work a lot of fun , as he conve@@ ys in the press meeting .
He reports of varied , but also demanding , tasks that await his success@@ ors .
At the same time , it sur@@ prises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile .
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the ear@@ liest possible opportunity .
This should then allow enough time for in@@ duction training - ob@@ serving usual notice periods .
As Has@@ lach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations , applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications .
For the town wants to maintain this role at all costs .
If it could no longer fulfil it , citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg for advice .
But accessibility for citizens is important to the town and to him too , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working atmosphere and a che@@ er@@ ful mood between authorities and citizens .
In more than 30 years in office , W@@ acker has am@@ ass@@ ed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride .
" We 're making the city li@@ ve@@ able , " is something he is certain of , re : the building authorities and his colleagues .
But in the future too , there are diverse projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of a former Hu@@ kl@@ a plot and of the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen car@@ park , for example , have been initiated .
The Kin@@ zig bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is being renovated , and refur@@ bish@@ ment of the stadium is still a topic .
The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros " if we do it properly , " estimates W@@ acker .
" All in all , there are great tasks a@@ waiting my successor .
The work here is fun . "
There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect .
With Has@@ lach 's own building yard and garden nur@@ ser@@ y , there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility .
" One can affect a lot , " says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned with pra@@ ise by citizens and visitors .
Since the old town as a whole has protected building status , it is important " to have an eye for what fits in " if new buildings are approved , stresses the out@@ going municipal architect .
In any case , the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility .
He is master of construction : " In the end , everything here passes by my desk . "
For support and coordination , he can count on years @@@ -@@ @ old colleagues : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( building construction ) has been there ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) , already 15 years .
W@@ acker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time : " We are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies with the post and wants to stay . "
For continuity is important not only for a good working atmosphere , but also for the future design of the city .
Any@@ one who wishes to take over from Roland W@@ acker should , according to the city of Has@@ lach , be able to demonstrate completed studies as gradu@@ ate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ ors degree with a speci@@ alisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws .
The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering , urban land @@@ -@@ @ use planning , land acquisition affairs , management of municipal property , the municipal de@@ pot with building yard and city nur@@ ser@@ y , and the lower board of building regulations , including preservation of sites of historic interest .
Bic@@ ycle thro@@ wn onto cables : southern railway closed
According to police , the as @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ yet unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator had thro@@ wn the blue bicycle onto the cables from the railway track over@@ pass in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
These were so badly damaged in the course of this that the appro@@ aching freight train had to be stopped .
Investi@@ g@@ ators are proce@@ eding on the assu@@ mption that there were two male perpet@@ r@@ ators and have been looking for them since last night .
A pink s@@ coo@@ ter and bic@@ y@@ cli@@ st were observed near to the scene of the incident by wit@@ nesses .
" This goes far beyond a ro@@ gu@@ ish p@@ rank , " said Ö@@ BB spo@@ kes@@ man Christoph Po@@ sch to the AP@@ A .
The perpet@@ r@@ ator or perpet@@ r@@ ators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger .
In addition to the damage to the lo@@ com@@ otive and facilities , as well as the time in delays and the costs for the rail replacement services , the perpet@@ r@@ ators could also be faced with railway customers ' penalty fees .
Al@@ together , one can expect a " considerable " sum , said the spo@@ kes@@ man .
The damage was rep@@ aired on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the southern railway stret@@ ch was able to be operated without ob@@ struc@@ tions .
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday afternoon , two of them were long @@@ -@@ @ distance trains .
Frei@@ ght trains were not cancelled , although they were delayed .
According to Ö@@ BB spo@@ kes@@ man Christoph Po@@ sch , around 200 metres of over@@ head lines had to be replaced .
In@@ sul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
Red meat , dairy , and chocolate could help re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ m@@ are for your di@@ ges@@ tive system .
But a new study claims quite the opposite : a diet rich in meat @@@ -@@ @ based protein and dairy tre@@ ats could help re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms of suff@@ er@@ ers of infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
The inc@@ ur@@ able condition , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the UK , causes stom@@ ach cra@@ mp@@ s and blo@@ ating , rec@@ ur@@ ring or blo@@ ody di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
While suff@@ er@@ ers are usually advised to do@@ dge meat and dairy to so@@ o@@ the their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found protein 's essential am@@ ino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps develop immune cells that foster a toler@@ ant gut .
Le@@ ad investig@@ ator Dr Marco Col@@ onna explained immune cells pat@@ rol the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hidden in the food don 't s@@ ne@@ ak into the body .
C@@ ells that are capable of trig@@ gering infl@@ amm@@ ation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance , protecting the body without damaging sensitive tis@@ sues .
When the balance til@@ ts too far toward infl@@ amm@@ ation , infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease can result .
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance @@@ -@@ @ promoting immune cell appears in mi@@ ce that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their gu@@ ts .
And the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells ' appearance .
Professor Col@@ onna said : ' We established a link between one bacter@@ ial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illu@@ s re@@ uter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
The more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mi@@ ce had in their diet , the more of these immune cells they had . ' 
He suggested if the same works in humans , a combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @@@ -@@ @ rich diet may foster a more toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory gut environment .
Post@@ doc@@ toral resear@@ cher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @@@ -@@ @ Bar@@ ra@@ gan@@ was studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mi@@ ce had such cells but another group of the same stra@@ in but hous@@ ed separately did not .
She susp@@ ected the difference had to do with the mi@@ ce 's gut micro@@ biom@@ es - the community of bacteria , viruses and f@@ ung@@ i that normally live within the gast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal trac@@ t .
The gu@@ ts of the mi@@ ce were DNA sequ@@ enced and it was found six bacter@@ ial species present in the mi@@ ce with the immune cells but ab@@ sent from the mi@@ ce without them .
Mi@@ ce re@@ ared in a steri@@ le environment so they l@@ acked a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells aro@@ se .
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers grew L. re@@ uter@@ i in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mi@@ ce .
The immune cells developed into the tolerance @@@ -@@ @ promoting cells .
When the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ aboli@@ sm known as ind@@ ole @@@ -@@ @ 3 @@@ -@@ @ lac@@ tic acid .
When the researchers dou@@ bled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mi@@ ce 's feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr Cer@@ v@@ antes @@@ -@@ @ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained people have the same tolerance @@@ -@@ @ promoting cells as mi@@ ce , and most of us shel@@ ter L. re@@ uter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal trac@@ ts .
It is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i in@@ duce the cells to develop in people as they do in mi@@ ce , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the inte@@ st@@ ines .
Poten@@ ti@@ ally , high levels of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i may in@@ duce expansion of this population . ' 
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho thinks Manchester United have signed a ' geni@@ us ' in N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United have signed a " geni@@ us " in N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
The £ 40@@ m signing from Chel@@ sea started the 2 @@@ -@@ @ 1 win in Dublin , United 's final pres@@ eas@@ on game before the U@@ ef@@ a Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role as the li@@ kes of Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ au@@ ded forward at will .
However , having been left out of the Blu@@ es ' pres@@ eas@@ on tour of Asia , M@@ atic was sever@@ ely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes , something Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season .
" He needs time but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho said .
" We will help him to be ready so@@ oner rather than later . "
As well as M@@ atic , fellow new sign@@ ings Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started the game at the Avi@@ va Stadium as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho started to shape his starting X@@ I for the start of the season .
The Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho still wanted another three sign@@ ings but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " of delivering three of his four priority sign@@ ings .
" To get three out of four I thank the club for that , " he added .
" I will be happ@@ ier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me . "
Boeing " pain@@ ts " Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky
The US aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ hou@@ ette of a Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky .
The pil@@ ots depar@@ ted from Se@@ attle in the US state of Washington , but the out@@ line began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mi@@ chi@@ gan and drew the shape of a Dre@@ am@@ liner over the USA - that 's thousands of kilometres .
The campaign la@@ sted 18 hours and one minute .
The shape of a Dre@@ am@@ liner could be seen on ra@@ dar screens .
The whole thing was an end@@ urance test for new engines .
Boeing hat already carried out such a promotion before .
The number " 7@@ 87 " was painted in the sky , along with the Boeing logo .
New low b@@ low for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
How the wind changes : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SP@@ D leader , Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked , with a certain alarm , to Berlin before elections .
No distur@@ ban@@ ces from party headquarters , no op@@ posing win@@ ds from the state - that was the campaign@@ ers ' biggest wish .
Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party , that has fundamentally changed .
Since then , employees from the Wil@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ Brand@@ t house have been ob@@ serving the events in the SP@@ D @@@ -@@ @ governed state capit@@ als with growing hor@@ ror .
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , you couldn 't even begin to describe as an op@@ posing wind .
Those were low blo@@ ws .
And one after the other at that .
After the surprising end to the red @@@ -@@ @ green majority in Lower Sax@@ ony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general sign of a move away from co@@ ali@@ tions of SP@@ D and Greens .
" This once again shows that Red @@@ -@@ @ Green simply can 't go@@ vern reli@@ ably , " said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to Red@@ aktions@@ netz@@ werk Deutschland ( RN@@ D ) .
The surprise re@@ sign@@ ation of a Green representative pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SP@@ D ) into a stark crisis .
Five months ahead of the state elections , his red @@@ -@@ @ green coalition thus lost their one @@@ -@@ @ vote majority over the opposition made up of CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
The national head of the Greens , Michael Kell@@ ner , has called on def@@ ecting Green representative in Lower Sax@@ ony El@@ ke T@@ westen to give up her seat .
The cross @@@ -@@ @ over to the CD@@ U represents a clear distor@@ tion of the voters ' will .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give up her seat , " said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to Red@@ aktions@@ Netzwerk Deutschland ( RN@@ D ) .
" It just can 't be true , " si@@ gh@@ ed an SP@@ D campaign@@ er , when the bad news reached party headquarters on Friday afternoon .
Stephan Weil , SP@@ D Prime Minister of Lower Sax@@ ony , is left without a governing majority after the cross @@@ -@@ @ over of Green representative El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U .
It is the present crisis in a long line of big and small disasters in SP@@ D state associations .
And no @@@ -@@ @ one knows what is coming next .
The mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expec@@ tedly decisive defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
A black eye , no more , his com@@ ra@@ des cont@@ ented themselves at the time .
After the state elections in Schles@@ wig @@@ -@@ @ Holstein and North Rhine @@@ -@@ @ West@@ pha@@ lia , everything was going to be different .
And it was too - in fact , everything was significantly worse .
The defeat in Kiel brought the SP@@ D into a tail@@ sp@@ in , and the Düsseldorf wash@@ out bow@@ led the party clean over .
Their pe@@ ers then pi@@ cked themselves up again in the weeks afterwards , with some effort .
Then , just as they had reg@@ ain@@ ed new faith , came the G @@@ -@@ @ 20 summit in Hamburg .
And with that came the next low b@@ low .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ ol@@ z , the last strong SP@@ D regional leader , lost his hal@@ o that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ be Philharmon@@ ic hall while his city was burning .
And because in the crisis talks afterwards , he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong .
Since then , Sch@@ ol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
And now Stephan Weil too .
Thanks to the VW emissions sc@@ andal and his role on the supervisory board , the Lower Sax@@ ony Prime Minister had already been facing criticism for some time .
L@@ ous@@ y pol@@ l results added to that .
Despite that , or perhaps precisely because of that , Weil has been attemp@@ ting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government .
The former may@@ or of Hanover 's attempts to build up his power in Berlin have not gone un@@ noticed by pe@@ ers in Martin Schulz 's ent@@ our@@ age .
They used to let him do as he liked , since they expected Weil to be a stabili@@ sing force for the party .
Now , just the opposite may happen .
In actual fact , Weil is not to blame for the Lower Sax@@ ony Greens ' party @@@ -@@ @ internal stri@@ fe .
And Schulz is certainly not .
For the time being , therefore , their pe@@ ers are taking pain@@ s to keep their ranks closed .
Their anger is directed towards the Greens , and above all , at the def@@ ecting parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
" It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms T@@ westen places her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the left wing in the SP@@ D parliamentary group , to Red@@ aktions@@ Netzwerk Deutschland ( RN@@ D ) .
Ms T@@ westen was voted into parliament not for her person , as a direct candidate , but on a Lower Sax@@ ony Green Party ticket , continued the Lower Sax@@ ony member of parliament .
The logical conclusion would be for her to give up her seat .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SP@@ D parliamentary group , deplo@@ red the " un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . "
" The will of the voters four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " said Op@@ per@@ mann , who as fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner is leading the Lower Sax@@ ony SP@@ D into the Bun@@ de@@ stag elections , to the RN@@ D .
" Now the personal career no@@ tions of a future CD@@ U representative is distor@@ ting the electoral result , " continued Op@@ per@@ mann .
He called for light to be shed on the circumstances surrounding the matter .
I want to know whether there was anything more there , or if additional commitments were made to the Lower Sax@@ ony CD@@ U .
Gran@@ t money for Town Centre I@@ II
Any@@ one who wants to renov@@ ate their out@@ dated house will soon be able to get support from the state .
Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives for ST@@ EG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Emp@@ fin@@ gen .
At the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler once more cast a gli@@ mp@@ se back to what has been the case so far .
Since 1991 , there have been re@@ generation areas in Emp@@ fin@@ gen .
Back then , in re@@ generation area I , from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount .
From 2005 to 2016 , in re@@ generation area II , the sub@@ sid@@ y still lay at 60 per cent .
For Sch@@ in@@ dler , the refur@@ bish@@ ments up until this point have been a " successful project " - it is ultimately important to support interior development too , and not only develop new construction areas .
On 4th April , word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a re@@ generation area I@@ II .
The grant amount is 8@@ 33@@ ,@@ 33@@ 3 euros , of which , 500@@ ,000 euros is to come from the federal state , the rest , from the municipality of Em@@ fin@@ gen .
How does a re@@ generation area come about ?
One will investigate , explains Sch@@ in@@ dler further , where the " truly old " houses are .
What also comes into play , however , is whether there is even any interest to renov@@ ate in the planned area at all .
If necessary , the area boundaries can also then be shi@@ fted again .
ST@@ EG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Go@@ tz@@ el .
Keller presented the content of the government and federal state " Sozi@@ ale Stadt " programme , within whose scope the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be implemented .
The core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alisation of town centres , the improvement of living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
The measures would be implemented on a property @@@ -@@ @ specific , that is , per @@@ -@@ @ premises , basis .
The re@@ generation area would then ultimately be laid down as stat@@ ute .
The appropri@@ ation period for the subsidies has been running from 1st January 2017 and will continue to do so until 30@@ th April 20@@ 26 .
First , however , stock@@ taking will be carried out until September of this year , as part of which , those with a stake in the re@@ generation area will receive a survey to fill out .
The resolution should prefer@@ ably follow in November or December , so that refur@@ bish@@ ments can be begun next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every community must carry out the af@@ ore@@ mentioned preliminary studies .
It 's about assessing the shortcomings in the urban design and deci@@ ding what will be renovated and to what extent .
A renov@@ ation comment will then be recorded in the land regi@@ stry for each premises .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to Emp@@ fin@@ gen again himself and get an idea of the location , he promised .
Go@@ tz@@ el stressed that the participation of those involved is an essential factor for the project 's success .
That is why there will be surve@@ ys , which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
The yellow survey is the " building and property survey , " which is about , among other things , the structural condition and the intentions for refur@@ bish@@ ment .
In the grey survey , the " budget and housing survey , " information can be provided on the size , break@@ down and residents of a living space .
The blue " business survey " is only filled out if business premises operate in the building .
It should be noted , however , Go@@ tz@@ el pointed out , that a filled @@@ -@@ @ out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money .
What is more , new building initiatives are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that funding would be allocated on a " first @@@ -@@ @ come , first @@@ -@@ @ served " basis - the early bird gets the wor@@ m .
It is not possible to " reserve " grant money for later .
To conclude , photos of the " Town Centre II " project were shown , to " sell " the idea of refur@@ bish@@ ment to those present .
British invent@@ or micro@@ chips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British invent@@ or has become the first in the country to be fitted with a micro@@ chip so he can open his front door , access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand .
Ste@@ ven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip im@@ plan@@ ted between his th@@ um@@ b and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
He has te@@ amed up with Dr Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consul@@ tant an@@ es@@ theti@@ st at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure the im@@ plant procedure is carried out to a medical standard .
The technology is similar to a micro@@ chip im@@ plan@@ ted for c@@ ats and dogs , and takes just 30 seconds .
Mr Nor@@ th@@ am 's company will also alter lo@@ cks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip , for a cost of £ 300 each lock .
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z@@ 4 , which starts when his hand is on the wheel .
White House Pro@@ p Co@@ st Ta@@ x@@ pay@@ ers Th@@ ous@@ ands
The White House 's decision to fly a Marine he@@ licopter to the South La@@ wn for an event high@@ lighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $ 24@@ ,000 , according to military records released to T@@ IM@@ E .
The green @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @@@ -@@ @ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is abo@@ ard , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the July 17 event at the White House show@@ c@@ asing American construction programs .
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior White House officials tou@@ red manufacturing products from all 50 states .
The Connec@@ tic@@ ut @@@ -@@ @ made he@@ licopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin , and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
The White House Military Office requested the he@@ licopter 's presence in a frag@@ mentary order , or F@@ RA@@ GO , bare@@ ly 36 hours before the he@@ licopter land@@ ed on the South La@@ wn for the " unusual " event , according to the records of Marine He@@ licopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the he@@ licopter .
" I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it 's such an unusual high visibility event , " the comm@@ ander of H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 em@@ ail@@ ed his superior , the Marine Deputy Comm@@ and@@ ant for Aviation , the day before the event .
The message indicated the he@@ licopter would arrive on the South La@@ wn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event , and remain until the la@@ wn was cle@@ ared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening .
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed , a second air@@ crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty @@@ -@@ @ hour restrictions .
The original flight crew was with the he@@ licopter during the event , while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground .
It was not clear from records provided to T@@ IM@@ E whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
The Hat@@ ch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees from using government property for political purposes .
Records indicate that H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 in@@ qui@@ red about whether the event might viol@@ ate the provision .
" One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Act and were informed it was not , " the comm@@ ander wrote .
" So@@ unds like you are lo@@ cked , " the Deputy Comm@@ and@@ ant rep@@ lied .
The " Made in America " event was designated an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .
But even official events have political over@@ t@@ ones .
At the event , the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then under@@ way in the Sen@@ ate and tou@@ ted efforts to rein in government regulations .
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
But requi@@ si@@ tioning their use solely for a photo @@@ -@@ @ op is unusual .
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential air@@ plane ta@@ xi@@ ed to the back@@ drop of his first campaign rally in Mel@@ bourne , Fl@@ a . , and his Twitter account is fl@@ ush with messages compla@@ ining about his predec@@ essor 's use of the presidential aircraft .
" The White House is thri@@ ll@@ ed with the ' Made In America ' show@@ case that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials , " said White House dep@@ uty press secre@@ tary Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South La@@ wn to practice deposi@@ ting the President of the United States at the White House with in@@ ches of precision .
When Trump was at the G @@@ -@@ @ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the air@@ crew 's training requirement for the month , an official said .
Unit he@@ licop@@ ters also fle@@ w an additional 11 hours that day for " non @@@ -@@ @ presidential support missions . "
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps featured at the event .
A spo@@ kes@@ person for Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in arran@@ ging for the he@@ licopter to be displayed on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ X @@@ -@@ @ 1 doesn 't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights , and determining the precise cost inc@@ urred by the event is difficult .
But according to Department of De@@ fense ho@@ ur@@ ly rates for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @@@ -@@ @ 3D is $ 24@@ ,@@ 380 per flight hour .
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ inia .
The White House ar@@ gues the true cost of operating the he@@ licopter is well below that rate .
" To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbur@@ sement rate estimates is highly mis@@ leading , " Wal@@ ters said .
" These rate estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other sun@@ k costs that are included in annual appropriations . "
According to a 2015 R@@ AND study , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include the cost of personnel , but do account for fuel , maintenance , and contracting costs .
At the time , former White House press secre@@ tary S@@ ean Sp@@ icer def@@ ended the use of the he@@ licopter for the event .
" The idea is to show@@ case this week things that are made in America , " Sp@@ icer said .
" And I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , I assume , hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that .
And I think , like most Americans , we 're all proud of the he@@ licopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to do .
So , of course , it 's appropriate to highlight that . "
It wasn 't clear whether Trump inter@@ acted with the he@@ licopter as he tou@@ red the South La@@ wn for the event , but he did step into the driver 's seat of a fire truck .
In@@ side the White House , Trump addressed Si@@ kor@@ sky representatives , jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
" I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "
TC B@@ W Ne@@ uss faces tri@@ cky task
Front run@@ ner of the second tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a is comp@@ eting at third @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ table Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
TC Blau @@@ -@@ @ Wei@@ ss Ne@@ uss is comp@@ eting tomorrow in Kiel , from 11@@ am , at third @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ table Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
Despite still fla@@ w@@ less results after five matches , the front run@@ ner of the second tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a is maintaining a sense of reality .
Team bo@@ ss Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opp@@ onent at any rate .
" This is a compact team that always plays in very similar formation .
In the back positions , in particular , I find the team very good . "
It is above all the imports from the high north that bring class and stability to Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
" Their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to Dav@@ is Cup appear@@ ances .
And they are also strong in doub@@ les , " says Z@@ ay , referring to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finnland ) , And@@ re Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin P@@ eder@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
" It will be difficult for us , as always .
You need a good dose of luck as well . "
The Ne@@ uss team for the trip to the high north is practically set .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier could give his debut for Blau @@@ -@@ @ Weiß .
If the F@@ ren@@ ch@@ man , currently still active in the chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , does not make it to the Bundes@@ lig@@ a match , then Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech ) , who is playing in the tournament in Liber@@ ec in the Czech Republic , will be called into action for the first time this season .
The as yet un@@ defe@@ ated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @@@ -@@ @ Casti@@ llo was still hit@@ ting balls with Belar@@ u@@ sian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in Kit@@ z@@ büh@@ el yesterday .
He should also be there in Kiel though , just like Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Loo@@ ts@@ ma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
After his two vic@@ tories last Sunday against the Club an der Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could also move back into the team .
If that 's not enough for the 18 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old from Hungary , who in January 2016 was still number one in the j@@ uni@@ or world rank@@ ings , someone from the co@@ aching staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay will fill out the squ@@ ad .
How America can harm OM@@ V
Donald Trump didn 't exactly look happy on Wednesday evening as he placed his signature under a bill that would see sanctions against Russia strengthened .
" In its ha@@ ste to pass this legislation , " Congress packed in some " un@@ constitutional provisions , " he gri@@ ped .
The reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels se@@ eth@@ ed at the US motion .
After all , the bill plans to pen@@ alise European companies that help Russi@@ ans build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
E@@ ver since , investors in Austria 's OM@@ V , which together with other European companies has co @@@ -@@ @ financed the construction of Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 , have been accord@@ ing@@ dly per@@ tur@@ bed .
The threat is enormous .
Nevertheless , it is too early to g@@ au@@ ge the consequences , according to the official statement from the Oil group .
In reality , Donald Trump would still have to put the sanctions into being himself through an executive order .
He has twelve weapons to choose from here .
" The press " has set out to see what the group could fight off and what could really do it harm .
Nar@@ cos season 3 tra@@ iler : With P@@ abl@@ o Es@@ co@@ bar gone , the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel take centre stage in Net@@ fli@@ x 's hit series
Despite season two of Nar@@ cos reve@@ aling P@@ abl@@ o Es@@ co@@ bar 's k@@ iller , Net@@ fli@@ x 's series is far from over .
Seas@@ on three and four have already been confirmed by the stre@@ aming service , the former receiving its first tra@@ iler , te@@ asing the show 's upcoming vil@@ la@@ ins .
With season three , the D@@ EA has turned their attention towards the rich@@ est drug trafficking organisation in the world : the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel .
L@@ ed by four powerful go@@ d@@ fa@@ thers , they operate " like a Fort@@ une 500 company " just with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ ber@@ to Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the car@@ tel 's leader , Miguel Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Den@@ is ) being the bra@@ ins , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alber@@ to Am@@ mann ) running the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z Lond@@ on@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) based in New York .
The newly released tra@@ iler sees Pedro Pascal return as Javier Pe@@ ña , the character en@@ listing American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement to help with the war on drugs .

Rol@@ l back in time : the city employs 46 kitchen assi@@ stan@@ ts
The city is once more organising the nur@@ ser@@ y lunch itself .
With designated contact persons for the children and place in the team .
The clock is being turned back in the city 's nur@@ series .
On the 1st September , the city of Kre@@ feld is once more taking the catering in the city 's nur@@ series ( Kit@@ as ) into its own hands .
For Son@@ ja P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz , dep@@ uty head of the youth welfare services department , this is good news : " We were all delighted . "
The cooking is still done off premises : a c@@ ater@@ er takes care of this task and delivers fresh@@ ly coo@@ ked , ch@@ illed food .
The city operates 46 nur@@ series in the district of Kre@@ feld ; in 44 of these , the children get a warm meal at mid@@ day .
In the last nur@@ ser@@ y year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables in each case , and demand is growing ste@@ adily .
" By now , it is not only children who are c@@ ared for 45 hours a week that eat in the K@@ ita at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , " explains P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz .
" The service is also available for the 35 @@@ -@@ @ hour care option , when children stay until 2@@ pm . "
46 part @@@ -@@ @ time staff are on kitchen duty on 1st September : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement them with sal@@ ad , cru@@ dit@@ és and fruit , put the meals into individual por@@ tions , hand out the food , clear up , was@@ h up and clean the kitchen .
" The workers are assigned to a fixed K@@ ita , " says P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz .
The size - there are two @@@ -@@ @ group and seven @@@ -@@ @ group establish@@ ments - dict@@ ates the number of hours worked .
" The kitchen assi@@ stan@@ ts now firmly belong in the K@@ ita team , " says P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz cont@@ ent@@ edly .
" That way they are much more closely involved , and it is easier for the nur@@ ser@@ y head to put educational concepts in place . "
Because it 's about this too : a healthy diet and cooking lessons .
" The children should help prepare the food . "
Direc@@ tly linking the kitchen staff to the team makes sense then .
For the children too .
" They have a known staff member in the K@@ ita , someone who is familiar to them , and not people who are continuously changing . "
This continuity is important for the children .
The cleaning of the nur@@ ser@@ y rooms - up until now also a task for the kitchen staff - will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel .
This option - the separation of cleaning and the kitchen service - not only improves the quality of the kitchen 's output , but also has the appeal of having turned out to be the most economical option for the city when compar@@ ing costs between in @@@ -@@ @ house and out@@ sourcing , said the press office .
And that is despite 46 new part @@@ -@@ @ time staff being employed .
" But these hours don 't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector , " says Son@@ ja P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz .
Afghan democracy depends on political role for women , U.@@ N@@ . says
Elec@@ tions can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , the head of the U.@@ N@@ . mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday .
Ni@@ chol@@ as Hay@@ so@@ m , acting head of the U.@@ N@@ . Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provin@@ cial council elections , three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly @@@ -@@ @ registered voters are women .
" The role of women cannot be over@@ stated , " he said in a statement Wednesday .
Elec@@ tions can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process .
Afghan provin@@ cial council and presidential elections take place April 5 .
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
This year 's elections mark the first time power is handed peac@@ efully from one democrati@@ cally elected government to the next .
Hay@@ so@@ m said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan 's democratic success .
The Afghan Independent El@@ ection Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters .

G@@ MB concern over investment at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie 's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking re@@ assurance from managers at bis@@ cu@@ it maker Mc@@ Vi@@ tie 's over its long @@@ -@@ @ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
More than 500 people work at the plant , which produces Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its , among other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ tie 's owner Pla@@ dis said it had invested more than £ 5m at the site in the last few years .
It added employees and union representatives " will be the first to know " if there were any changes to its operations .
In a letter to the company 's site manager , G@@ MB Scotland called on Mc@@ Vi@@ tie 's to " address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines . "
G@@ MB senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : " The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerning our members .
Gener@@ ations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area , a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
So , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the back@@ drop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline , the east end of Glasgow desper@@ ately needs a thri@@ ving manufacturing presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie 's . "
A spo@@ kes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : " The site manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives .
We had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed op@@ enly .
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive .
She added : " In recent years , we have invested over £ 5m in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , notably on production lines and operational improvements .
We fully recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . "
Di@@ d PS@@ G war@@ n Barcelona about move for Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
La Li@@ ga side may ru@@ e their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @@@ -@@ @ Ger@@ main will not let up in their pursu@@ it of Ne@@ y@@ mar after lo@@ dging a £ 18@@ 9@@ m offer to trigger his release clause , but did they war@@ n Barcelona of the world @@@ -@@ @ record raid three years ago ?
The sens@@ ational approach has lit up the summer transfer window , with the Li@@ gue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark , which saw Paul Po@@ g@@ ba return to Manchester United last season for £ 89@@ m .
Once completed , the move will see Ne@@ y@@ mar become the world 's most expensive player and also the highest @@@ -@@ @ paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world , with PS@@ G offering wages of over £ 500@@ ,000 @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ week after tax .
Barcelona are known to be fur@@ i@@ ous with the manner of the approach and the way that Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , despite a source close to the Catal@@ ans ' board insi@@ sting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
But was the football world war@@ ned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di in 2014 , N@@ asser Al @@@ -@@ @ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PS@@ G 's best players .
" I am not wor@@ ried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we 'll contact their players , " Al @@@ -@@ @ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
" We respect all clubs .
But if they try to sign one of our players , they 'll face consequences . "
Barcelona appear to have cross@@ ed this line , with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti earlier this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could well be feeling the re@@ perc@@ ussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Ne@@ y@@ mar .

Police are seeking wit@@ nesses in relation to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese
Because a car was coming towards him in his lan@@ e , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to s@@ wer@@ ve and gra@@ zed the cra@@ sh barrier .
On Thursday evening , at around 7.@@ 55@@ pm , the 34 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old from Reh@@ burg @@@ -@@ @ Lo@@ cc@@ um was en route in his VW on the B2@@ 15 coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
In the region of the Stol@@ zen@@ au b@@ yp@@ ass , a passenger car came towards him in his lan@@ e , so he had to s@@ wer@@ ve to the right .
In doing so , the Tour@@ an driver gra@@ zed the cra@@ sh barrier .
The car suffered material damage .
The driver of the on@@ coming car , a Mercedes B@@ enz , had over@@ taken a lor@@ ry and continued his journey without concerning himself with the traffic accident .
According to information provided by the victim of the accident , it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .

Interview : " Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates Pope brother Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger "
The Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on cases of abuse ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates Pope brother Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger .
That is what author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann says .
The final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen is still causing debate .
After its publication , Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spo@@ kes@@ man for the reform movement " We are Church , " explained to the German press agency that he was exp@@ ecting an ap@@ ology from the former Bishop of Re@@ gens@@ burg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral 's Master of Music , Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger , the 93 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old brother of the emer@@ it@@ us Pope Ben@@ edi@@ kt XVI .
It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Rat@@ z@@ inger were to express their deep regret over their own fail@@ ures or their false assessments of events back then .
The Vatican paper " Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , " on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen using " double standards . "
With respect to the ass@@ aul@@ ts in Re@@ gens@@ burg , no @@@ -@@ @ one doubts that these were " dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful and sham@@ e@@ ful acts " that must be pun@@ ished and prevented in future ; however , what was striking was the " level of media manip@@ ulation , " according to the author Lu@@ c@@ etta S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the Italian National Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
" The hab@@ it of den@@ oting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is now a part of our everyday experience and sets up public opinion for considering that as normal , " writes S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia .
Princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio that " people love to let loo@@ se on the Church , and it is an easy target . "
She also pointed out that in her youth " be@@ atings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with che@@ ek@@ y children , of which I was one . "
She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse , Pope brother Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger c@@ rop@@ ped up a lot .
Absol@@ utely unfair , says author and hist@@ orian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who together with Rat@@ z@@ inger compiled the commem@@ or@@ ative volume " My Bro@@ ther , the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .
" I have to come to the defence of Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger , " says H@@ es@@ emann , for in his assessment , the result of the final report " has nothing to do with him . "
What exactly is in the 4@@ 40 @@@ -@@ @ page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the Di@@ oc@@ ese of Re@@ gens@@ burg , has produced ?
In total , 5@@ 47 members of the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were " highly likely " the victims of ass@@ aul@@ ts between 1945 and the early 1990s , and 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
The final report said of Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger , who was working in Re@@ gens@@ burg from 1964 to 1994 , that " in summary , it can be determined that forms of corpor@@ al and physical violence were used by the cathedral 's Master of Music R. in many cases . "
When he was highly emotional , in particular , the punishment for the students could be a lot more severe .
Despite this , it is apparent that , in contrast to numerous others of the accused , many victims treas@@ ured the general human@@ eness of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even associ@@ ate him with positive memories , despite the violence . "
H@@ es@@ emann explains in the interview why , in his opinion , the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger .
For Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 4@@ 40 @@@ -@@ @ page report on the " inci@@ dents of the use of violence against wards at the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen " pain@@ ts a contradic@@ tory picture of the cathedral 's Master of Music , Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger .
On the one hand , many students stress his " human@@ eness . "
On the other hand , he also comes across as a chol@@ eric type and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who would often turn to violence if one of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen didn 't give a top musical performance .
How do you judge this final report as his bio@@ graphy ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : If one makes the effort and reads the entire 4@@ 40 @@@ -@@ @ page @@@ -@@ @ long report from start to finish , one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger is doing in there at all .
Ei@@ ght pages are devoted to him , all in one go , and he is clearly ex@@ cul@@ p@@ ated from every suspi@@ ci@@ on of complic@@ ity or con@@ ni@@ v@@ ance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
The extreme acts of violence at the p@@ re @@@ -@@ @ school also occurred outside his sphere of activity .
At best , one can acc@@ use him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough .
The Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen secondary school , where he was active , was perceived by practically all of those asked as - to quote - " salvation , " " heaven " and a " better world . "
So , the vast majority of his students gave Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger a quite g@@ lowing testim@@ oni@@ al , descri@@ bing him as " warm @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted , " " bel@@ o@@ ved , " " sincere , " " competent " and " understanding , " as an extremely good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provide the boys with c@@ akes , bis@@ cu@@ its and swe@@ ets and was " always mo@@ b@@ bed by clu@@ sters of children . "
Only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emo@@ tionality , which from time to time also led to out@@ bur@@ sts of anger .
The fact that during the course of this he not only b@@ ang@@ ed chairs and thre@@ w his b@@ unch of keys to the floor , but even handed out sla@@ ps around the face and pul@@ led on the hair or ears of all @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ imp@@ u@@ dent boys is something that he himself already admitted years ago , that he deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ olog@@ ises for .
In his defence , however , it must also be said that such methods of education in that question@@ able period between the 196@@ 0s and 197@@ 0s were wide @@@ -@@ @ spread amongst parents as well as teachers .
Do you remember such cas@@ tig@@ ation methods ?
I 'm thinking of those of us who were born before 1968 , of course .
I too experienced that , in a sec@@ ular school , too , a state G@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
Comp@@ ared to what this report is actually about , namely , app@@ alling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at pre@@ school , these are of course mere tri@@ f@@ les .
So one cannot help but ask whether the fact that lots of media are bearing down on him in particular does not have more to do with his f@@ ame and his role as the brother of Ben@@ edi@@ kt XVI .
Indeed , lots of people are still sla@@ ving away assi@@ du@@ ously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him .
But the truth is : the report ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger in every way !
In the media , there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen in connection with the report .
Is Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complic@@ ity in respect of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : Qu@@ ite clearly not .
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts claims to have confi@@ ded in the cathedral 's Master of Music .
Not once were the parents brought in the loo@@ p .
" I never da@@ red talk about it with my father or my mother , " said one of those affected , as a representative for the others , " It was always very embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ing for me . "
But the real problem when it comes to thro@@ wing light on sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims stay silent out of sh@@ ame .
If they don 't even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then they for sure are not going to to a choir leader , who after all had been a professional colleague , as it were , of the perpet@@ r@@ ators .
How do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen scho@@ ol@@ boys judge Rat@@ z@@ inger 's role in respect of the cases of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : One pup@@ il asked put it this way : " Regarding sexual abuse .@@ .. I see .@@ .. no case where he of all people ( Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger ) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ators in question .
I also think .@@ .. it is quite absurd to assume that .@@ .. boys opened up more em@@ ph@@ ati@@ cally or clearly or even so@@ oner to him , of all people , than to their parents , the heads of their boarding houses , ment@@ ors etc .
That one would speak with him about sex .@@ .. - un@@ thin@@ k@@ able . "
So , the report comes to the quite clear conclusion : " That affected pupils and / or those around them confi@@ ded in him be@@ fore@@ hand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . "
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger has therefore been absol@@ ved of any complic@@ ity .
Therefore , he can also not be accused of not having stopped it or reported it .
There is therefore also no reason to bring his good name into association with this des@@ pic@@ able crime , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
In the media , one read a lot about " extreme acts of violence " at the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
The former cathedral Master of Music , Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger , is accused in the report of " turning a blind eye . "
Does he have to live with this acc@@ us@@ ation then ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : That is indeed the big problem , that in the coverage , everything was mixed up and con@@ founded into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and some@@ where , in the middle of that , was Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger .
But precisely that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .
That is to say , there is a clean separation there : between the pre@@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as , shall we say , other acc@@ us@@ ations .
What is more , the report hand@@ les cases from the period since 1945 , that is , from four decades , as well , when Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger was not choir leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
The whole hi@@ de@@ ous educational theory of span@@ king , the cases where boys were down@@ right bul@@ lied and mal@@ treated by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers , and from which they suffered terri@@ bly , all of these took place in the pre@@ school in E@@ tter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous conditions must have prev@@ ail@@ ed .
Yet the cathedral 's Master of Music Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger had nothing to do with these , for he first set eyes on the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen secondary school .
There , as the vast majority of wit@@ nesses stress , the topic of the " pre@@ school " was t@@ abo@@ o .
One was only happy to have got away from it and enjoyed the much better treatment and the conditions that were even " par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al " for many .
What was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen secondary school then ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : Dis@@ cipl@@ ine still ruled there , sure , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
And that applies to Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger li@@ kewise , in relation to whom the report conclu@@ des that " many victims treas@@ ured the general human@@ eness of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even associ@@ ate him with positive memories , despite the violence . "
So , at best , there remains the acc@@ us@@ ation of having turned a blind eye .
Yet despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was given reports about the conditions at the pre@@ school .
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then next only in around 1993 .
Di@@ d Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger systematically close his ears to the conditions ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : No , for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen secondary school , which was even re@@ produced in the report .
In that , he pointed this out , " that in the pre@@ school corpor@@ al punishment is still practi@@ sed . "
Even when facing the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention .
That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corpor@@ al punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too .
Before that , it was taking place in a legal grey zone , as every one of us well knows .
So it was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating or dramati@@ sing and where the per@@ missible limits had really been over@@ step@@ ped .
But one cannot say that he always turned a blind eye .
That is simply not true .
It was first in 1980 that corpor@@ al punishment in schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria as well .
Princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis indeed asser@@ ts that it is unfair to apply today 's educational standards to that earlier time .
What is your opinion on this ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : We hist@@ ori@@ ans talk here about " the pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , " that is , the danger of evalu@@ ating the past according to today 's moral standards .
The Princ@@ ess is quite right here .
But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was des@@ pic@@ able at all times , and also not to that which was perpet@@ rated in the pre@@ school in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children ; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then .
That is all absolutely terrible and I am glad that it is finally being looked into .
But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger , for all that has nothing to do with him .
His means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is , sla@@ pping around the face and pul@@ ling the hair and ears , was widespread in the 197@@ 0s .
When corpor@@ al punishment was then banned , he comp@@ lied strictly with that too .
What image of his time in Re@@ gens@@ burg did Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger reflect then in his convers@@ ations with you for the book " My Bro@@ ther , the Pope " ?
Di@@ d the subject of corpor@@ al punishment ever come up ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : Look , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is Pope Ben@@ edi@@ kt XVI . , told from his perspective , so the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a subsidiary role .
Nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ eal that he ran a strict regime there .
But this too has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without this demand for absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to for@@ ge from the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen - up until that point famous rather on a national level - a world @@@ -@@ @ class institution , a cultural am@@ bassador for Europe and its musical tradition , that twice a @@@ -@@ @ piece went on tour to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and to Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
Not with bis@@ cu@@ its and swe@@ ets alone does one all at once turn in@@ sub@@ ordin@@ ate boys into great sin@@ gers , and face every success , regardless of the area , but rather , with continuous discipline , passion and self @@@ -@@ @ con@@ quest .
What kind of impression did you get of Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger the man then in those convers@@ ations for your book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : Through the work on the book and beyond that , I got to know Georg Rat@@ z@@ inger really very well , and my experience of him was always as a wonderful , hum@@ or@@ ous , totally ben@@ evol@@ ent , deeply dev@@ out and good @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted man , who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hur@@ ting a fly .
I regularly hear how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still today keep in regular contact with him , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
Those who up until today still do not for@@ give him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority .
Most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are today grateful to him for enri@@ ching their lives and bringing them near@@ er to the world of music .
And for always being a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may well be - but also a lo@@ ving person , to be respected , whom they still look up to today and down@@ right wor@@ ship .
And please , once more , just to be clear : all that he is accused of are methods of education , that back then were order of the day .
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
But it is highly un@@ just to make a media scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .
The evil intention behind that is all too obvious .
For the report that was just published ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates him .
Now one would ask for the dec@@ ency to finally leave in peace a 93 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old man who has ren@@ dered great service and without whom probably no @@@ -@@ @ one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Re@@ gens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen
